# TANGNN & ArxivNet Dataset

## Overview
This project comprises two main components: the TANGNN algorithm and the ArxivNet dataset. 
Partial datasets are shown in the processed01 directory.

## Detailed Description
### ArxivNet Dataset
The ArxivNet of this project includes a large citation network dataset tailored for deep learning. It also provides a detailed introduction to the extraction process and the sentiment analysis pipeline used to enrich the dataset. For an in-depth look at the dataset structure, extraction methodology, and analysis techniques, refer to the [ArxivNet README](./ArxivNet/README.md).

### TANGNN Algorithm
TANGNN is our main algorithm, including TANGNN, TANGNN-LC, TANGNN-FLC, TANGNN-NAI, TANGNN-TAI.
