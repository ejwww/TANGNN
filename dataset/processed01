For fields near a level\ncrossing, the cluster can be approximated by a two-level Hamiltonian at low\ntemperatures. Perturbations, such as magnetic anisotropy or spin-phonon\ncoupling, sensitively affect the behavior at the level-crossing points. The\ngeneral two-level Hamiltonian of the spin system is derived in first-order\nperturbation theory, and the thermodynamic functions magnetization, magnetic\ntorque, and magnetic specific heat are calculated. Then a magneto-elastic\ncoupling is introduced and the effective two-level Hamilitonian for the\nspin-lattice system derived in the adiabatic approximation of the phonons. At\nthe level crossings the system becomes unconditionally unstable against lattice\ndistortions due to the effects of magnetic anisotropy. The resultant\nmagneto-elastic instabilities at the level crossings are discussed, as well as\nthe magnetic behavior.\n"

An analytical solution\nis found for the evolution of the crack length as a function of time, the time\nto rupture and the statistics of the crack jumps. These theoretical predictions\nare verified by studying experimentally the subcritical growth of a single\ncrack in thin sheets of paper. A good agreement between the theoretical\npredictions and the experimental results is found. In particular, our model\nsuggests that the statistical stress fluctuations trigger rupture events at a\nnanometric scale corresponding to the diameter of cellulose microfibrils.\n"

We limit ourselves to the case when\nthe molecular shape anisotropy, represented by the alignment tensor, is a\nrandom variable of an annealed type. A prototype of such behavior can be found\nin lyotropic systems - a mixture of potassium laurate, 1-decanol, and $D_2O$,\nwhere distribution of the micellar shape adjusts to actual equilibrium\nconditions. Further examples of materials with the biaxial nematic phase, where\nmolecular shape is subject to fluctuations, are thermotropic materials composed\nof flexible trimeric- or tetrapod-like molecular units. Our calculations show\nthat the Gaussian equilibrium distribution of the variables describing\nmolecular shape (dispersion force) anisotropy gives rise to new classes of the\nphase diagrams, absent in the original model. Depending on properties of the\nshape fluctuations, the stability of the biaxial nematic phase can be either\nenhanced or depressed, relative to the uniaxial nematic phases. In the former\ncase the splitting of the Landau point into two triple points with a direct\nphase transition line from isotropic to biaxial phase is observed.\n"

We observe that in the grandcanonical ensemble the phase transition\nhas no latent heat, but it has a finite jump in the particle number.

We show that every car will be stopped only a finite\nnumber of times and that the final relative car positions is again a Poisson\nprocess with parameter $\\lambda$.

We investigated the magnetic\nstructure of nominally 10% Cd-doped CeCoIn5, being antiferromagnetically\nordered below T_N=3 K and superconducting below T_c=1.3 K, by elastic neutron\nscattering. Magnetic intensity was observed only at the ordering wave vector\nQ_AF = (1/2,1/2,1/2) commensurate with the crystal lattice. Upon entering the\nsuperconducting state the magnetic intensity seems to change only little.

We find that the double superconducting\ntransition in the specific heat Tc1~1.89K and Tc2~1.72K tends to appear in\nsamples with a large residual resistivity ratio, large specific heat jump at\nthe superconducting transition and with the highest absolute value of the\nspecific heat above Tc1. However, we present evidence which casts doubt on the\nintrinsic nature of the double superconducting transition. The ratio of the two\nspecific heat jumps \\Delta C(Tc1)/\\Delta C(Tc2) shows a wide range of values on\ncrystals from different batches but also within the same batch. This ratio was\nstrongly reduced by polishing a sample down to 120um. Remarkably, three samples\nexhibit a single sharp transition of ~15mK in width at Tc~1.7K. The normalized\nspecific heat jump (C-Cnormal)/Cnormal at Tc of two of them is higher than ~32%\nso larger than the sum of the two specific heat jumps when a double transition\nexists. As an evidence of better quality, the slope in the transition is at\nleast two time steeper.\n  We discuss the origins of the double transition; in particular we consider,\nbased on X-ray diffraction results, a scenario involving Pr-vacancies. The\nsuperconducting phase diagram under magnetic field of a sample with a single\ntransition is fitted with a two-band model taking into account the good values\nfor the gap as deduced from thermal conductivity measurements.\n"

        "title-abstract": "Control of electron spin decoherence caused by electron-nuclear spin\n  dynamics in a quantum dot:   Control of electron spin decoherence in contact with a mesoscopic bath of\nmany interacting nuclear spins in an InAs quantum dot is studied by solving the\ncoupled quantum dynamics. The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated\nevolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the\nwhich-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its\ncoherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a\npair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise\nflip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped\ninto the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a\ngeometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control\nschemes. A close examination of nuclear bath dynamics reveals a wealth of\nphenomena and new possibilities of controlling the electron spin decoherence.\nFor example, when the electron spin is flipped by a $\\pi$-pulse at $\\tau$, its\ncoherence will partially recover at $\\sqrt{2}\\tau$ as a consequence of quantum\ndisentanglement from the mesoscopic bath. In contrast to the re-focusing of\ninhomogeneously broadened phases by conventional spin-echoes, the\ndisentanglement is realized through shepherding quantum evolution of the bath\nstate via control of the quantum object. A concatenated construction of pulse\nsequences can eliminate the decoherence with arbitrary accuracy, with the\nnuclear-nuclear spin interaction strength acting as the controlling small\nparameter.\n"

The use of a scanner plus image recognition\nsoftware enables us to automatically count and size up to tens of thousands of\ntiny droplets with a smallest detectable volume of approximately 0.02 nl. Upon\nvarying the gas pressure, a critical value is found where the size-distribution\nbecomes a pure power-law, a fact that is indicative of a phase transition. Away\nfrom this transition, the resulting size distributions are well described by\nFisher's model at coexistence. It is found that the sign of the surface\ncorrection term changes sign, and the apparent power-law exponent tau has a\nsteep minimum, at criticality, as previously reported in Nuclear\nMultifragmentation studies [1,2]. We argue that the observed transition is not\npercolative, and introduce the concept of dominance in order to characterize\nit. The dominance probability is found to go to zero sharply at the transition.\nSimple arguments suggest that the correlation length exponent is nu=1/2. The\nsizes of the largest and average fragments, on the other hand, do not go to\nzero but behave in a way that appears to be consistent with recent predictions\nof Ashurst and Holian [3,4].\n"

Experiments show a phase diagram with these features for phosphorous\nand triphenyl-phosphite. Liquid-liquid phase transition could be relevant for\nwater, silica, liquid metals, colloids and protein solutions, among others.\nHere we compare two potentials with short-range soft-core repulsion and narrow\nattraction. One of them is a squared potential that is known to have\nliquid-liquid phase transition, ending in a critical point, and no anomaly in\ndensity. The normal, monotonic, behavior of density for isobaric cooling is\nsurprising if compared with molecular liquids, such as water, where a\nhypothetical critical point is proposed as rationale for the anomalous behavior\nof density. The second potential is a continuous version of the first. We show\nthat the phase diagram associated to this new potential has, not only the\nliquid-liquid phase transition, but also the density anomaly. Our result,\ntherefore, shows that the behavior in density is strongly dependent on the\nderivative of the potential.\n"

The Xe atoms with a planar configuration are in a liquid state\nat a typical reactor temperature of 1000 K, which presents a modulated\nlayer-structure near the interface with solid UO2. A planar defects loop\nremains after these Xe atoms are released out.\n"

Structural properties of the network including the height\ndistribution, the diameter of the network, the average distance between two\nnodes, and the fraction of dangling nodes are also obtained analytically.\nInterestingly, the deletion process leads to a giant hub, a single node with a\nmacroscopic degree whereas all other nodes have a microscopic degree.\n"

Using a spin coherent path\nintegral, we show that in this limit the electron spin evolution is well\ndescribed by classical dynamics of both the nuclear and electron spins. We then\nintroduce approximate yet systematic methods to analyze aspects of the\nclassical dynamics, and discuss the importance of the exact integrability of\nthe central spin Hamiltonian. This is compared with numerical simulation.\nFinally, we obtain the asymptotic long time decay of the electron spin\npolarization. We show that this is insensitive to integrability, and determined\ninstead by the transfer of angular momentum to very weakly coupled spins far\nfrom the center of the quantum dot.

In the mean-field approximation without Coulomb interaction, the\nsystem displays a phase transition of first order. In the presence of the\nCoulomb repulsion the global phase separation becomes unfavorable and the\nsystem shows a mesoscopic phase separation, where the size of the charged\nregions is determined by the competition between the ordering energy and the\nCoulomb energy.\n  The phase diagram of the system as a function of particle density and\ntemperature is obtained by systematic Monte Carlo simulations. With decreasing\ntemperature a crossover from a disordered state to a state composed from\nmesoscopic charged clusters is observed. In the phase separated state charged\nclusters with even number of particles are more stable than those with odd\nnumber of particles in a large range of particle densities. With increasing\nparticle density at low temperatures a series of crossovers between states with\ndifferent cluster sizes is observed. Above half filling in addition to the low\ntemperature clustering another higher temperature scale, which corresponds to\norbital ordering of particles, appears.\n  We suggest that the diverse functional behaviour - including\nsuperconductivity - observed in transition metal oxides can be thought to arise\nfrom the self-organization of this type.\n"

The contributions\nto the magnetic anisotropy were determined by measuring the angular- and the\ntemperature-dependencies of the FMR resonance fields and by superconducting\nquantum interference device magnetometry. The largest contribution to the\nanisotropy is a uniaxial component perpendicular to the film plane; however, a\nnegative contribution from cubic anisotropy is also found. Additional in-plane\nuniaxial components are observed at low temperatures, which lift the degeneracy\nbetween the in-plane [011] and [01-1] directions as well as between the\nin-plane [010] and [001] directions. Near T=5K, the easy magnetization axis is\nclose to the in-plane [01-1] direction. All anisotropy parameters decrease with\nincreasing temperature and disappear above the Curie temperature T_C.

For these transitions, the Q dependence is related to the\nspin density map in the ground state, which in turn is governed by the\nHeisenberg exchange interactions in the cluster. This provides the possibility\nto infer the exchange-coupling constants from the Q dependence of the INS\ntransitions within the spin ground state. The potential of this strategy is\nexplored for the M = +-10 -> +- 9 transition within the S = 10 multiplet of the\nmolecule Mn12 as an example. The Q dependence is calculated for powder as well\nas single-crystal Mn12 samples for various exchange-coupling situations\ndiscussed in the literature. The results are compared to literature data on a\npowder sample of Mn12 and to measurements on an oriented array of about 500\nsingle-crystals of Mn12. The calculated Q dependence exhibits significant\nvariation with the exchange-coupling constants, in particular for a\nsingle-crystal sample, but the experimental findings did not permit an\nunambiguous determination. However, although challenging, suitable experiments\nare within the reach of today's instruments.\n"

In a physical\nsituation, these bosonic environments can correspond either to deconfined\nspinons in certain classes of Z_2 frustrated antiferromagnets, or to particles\nin a multicomponent Bose gase (in which case the spin degree of freedom is\nattributed to hyperfine levels). Using renormalization group techniques, we\nestablish that our impurity models, which feature an exchange interaction\nanalogous to Kondo impurities in Fermi liquids, allow the flow towards a stable\nstrong-coupling state. Since the low-energy bosons live around a single point\nin momentum space, and there is no Fermi surface, an impurity quantum phase\ntransition occurs at intermediate coupling, separating screened and unscreened\nphases. This behavior is qualitatively different from previously studied\nspin-isotropic variants of the spin-boson model, which display stable\nintermediate-coupling fixed points and no screening.\n"

We implement this in the context of the asymmetric\nexclusion process. The nonlocal skids promote strong clustering in the\nstationary populated phase. Such clusters drive the dynamic phase transition\nand determine its scaling properties. We numerically establish that the\ninstability transition into the ER phase is second order in the regime where\nthe entry point reservoir controls the current and first order in the regime\nwhere the bulk is in control. The first order transition originates from a\nturn-about of the cluster drift velocity. At the critical line, the current\nremains analytic, the road density vanishes linearly, and fluctuations scale as\nuncorrelated noise. A self-consistent cluster dynamics analysis explains why\nthese scaling properties remain that simple.\n"

A general formula is derived that is applicable to models with a\nnon-degenerate ground state. We calculate exact transition probabilities for a\nqubit coupled to either a bosonic or a spin bath. The nature of the baths and\nthe qubit-bath coupling is reflected in the transition probabilities. For\ndiagonal coupling, when the bath causes energy fluctuations of the diabatic\nqubit states but no transitions between them, the transition probability\ncoincides with the standard LZ probability of an isolated qubit. This result is\nuniversal as it does not depend on the specific type of bath. For pure\noff-diagonal coupling, by contrast, the tunneling probability is sensitive to\nthe coupling strength. We discuss the relevance of our results for experiments\non molecular nanomagnets, in circuit QED, and for the fast-pulse readout of\nsuperconducting phase qubits.\n"

CORE is a\npowerful non-perturbative technique that can reduce the complexity of a given\nmicroscopic model by focusing on the low-energy part. We provide a detailed\nanalysis of frustrated spin ladders which have been widely studied in the past:\nin particular, we discuss how to choose the building block and emphasize the\nuse of their reduced density matrix. With a good choice of basis, CORE is able\nto reproduce the existence or not of magnetization plateaux in the whole phase\ndiagram contrary to usual perturbation theory. We also address the issue of\nplateau formation in two-dimensional bilayers and point out the analogy between\nnon-frustrated strongly anisotropic models and frustrated SU(2) ones.\n"

We find that, even for nominal weak\nelectron-phonon interaction, for strong spin-orbit couplings the electrons\nbehave as effectively strongly coupled to the phonons. We interpret this result\nby a topological change of the Fermi surface occurring at sufficiently strong\nspin-orbit coupling, which induces a square-root divergence in the electronic\ndensity of states at low energies. We provide results for $m^*/m$ and for the\ndensity of states of the interacting electrons for several values of the\nelectron filling and of the spin-orbit interaction.\n"

They transform the chemical energy into the mechanical\nwork and move unidirectionally along rigid cytoskeleton filaments.\nSingle-molecule experiments suggest that motor proteins, consisting of two\nmotor domains, move in a hand-over-hand mechanism when each subunit changes\nbetween trailing and leading positions in alternating steps, and these subunits\ndo not interact with each other. However, recent experiments on heterodimeric\nkinesins suggest that the motion of motor domains is not independent, but\nrather strongly coupled and coordinated, although the mechanism of these\ninteractions are not known. We propose a simple discrete stochastic model to\ndescribe the dynamics of homodimeric and heterodimeric two-headed motor\nproteins. It is argued that interactions between motor domains modify free\nenergy landscapes of each motor subunit, and motor proteins still move via the\nhand-over-hand mechanism but with different transitions rates. Our calculations\nof biophysical properties agree with experimental observations. Several ways to\ntest the theoretical model are proposed.\n"

The\nspheroidal geometry of a slightly elliptically deformed sphere was used as a\npossible approach to fullerenes. We assumed that for a small deformation the\neccentricity of the spheroid is much more smaller then one. We are interested\nin the elliptically deformed fullerenes C70 as well as in C60 and its spherical\ngeneralizations like big C240 and C540 molecules. In the next study the\nexpanded field-theory model was proposed to study the electronic states near\nthe Fermi energy in spheroidal fullerenes. The low energy electronic wave\nfunctions obey a two-dimensional Dirac equation on a spheroid with two kinds of\ngauge fluxes taken into account. We shown exactly how a small deformation of\nspherical fullerenes provokes an appearance of fine structure in the electronic\nenergy spectrum as compared to the spherical case. The effect of a weak uniform\nmagnetic field on the electronic structure of slightly deformed fullerene\nmolecules was also studied. We shown that the fine structure of the electronic\nenergy spectrum is very sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field. We\nfound that the magnetic field pointed in the x direction does not influence the\nfirst electronic level whereas it causes a splitting of the second energy\nlevel.\n"

We show that the\nhydrogen desorption enthalpy can be reduced by ~0.1 eV/H2 if one in eight Ni\natoms is replaced by Cu or Fe. Replacing Ni by Co atoms, however, increases the\nhydrogen desorption enthalpy. We study the thermodynamic stability of the\ndopants in the hydrogenated and dehydrogenated phases. Doping with Co or Cu\nleads to marginally stable compounds, whereas doping with Fe leads to an\nunstable compound. The optical response of Mg2NiH4 is also substantially\naffected by doping. The optical gap in Mg2NiH4 is ~1.7 eV. Doping with Co, Fe\nor Cu leads to impurity bands that reduce the optical gap by up to 0.5 eV.\n"

It is found that there is the range of fractal\ndimension where this distribution has anomalous statistical properties,\nspecifically, its dispersion becomes infinite. It is examined how the finite\nresolution capacity of the cluster geometric size measurement affects the\nestimated value of fractal dimension. The effect of fractal properties of the\nnormal phase clusters on the electric field arisen from magnetic flux motion is\ninvestigated for the cluster area distribution of different kinds. The\nvoltage-current characteristics of fractal superconducting structures in the\nresistive state are obtained for an arbitrary fractal dimension.

CDW formation\nis driven by Fermi surface (FS) nesting, however characterized by a\nsurprisingly smaller gap (50meV) than seen in the double layer RTe_3 compounds,\nextending over the entire FS. This establishes LaTe_2 as the first reported\nsemiconducting 2D CDW system where the CDW phase is FS nesting driven. In\naddition, the layer dependence of this phase in the tellurides and the possible\ntransition from a stripe to a checkerboard phase is discussed.\n"

Our models use a description in terms\nof small deviations of particle coordinates from a set of reference positions,\nparticularly appropriate for the description of low-temperature phenomena. A\nBorn-von-Karman type expansion with random coefficients is used to model\neffects of frozen heterogeneities. The key quantity appearing in the\ntheoretical description is a full distribution of effective single-site\npotentials which needs to be determined self-consistently. If microscopic\ninteractions are harmonic, the effective single-site potentials turn out to be\nharmonic as well, and the distribution of these single-site potentials is\nequivalent to a distribution of localization lengths used earlier in the\ndescription of chemical gels. For structural glasses characterized by\nfrustration and anharmonicities in the microscopic interactions, the\ndistribution of single-site potentials involves anharmonicities of all orders,\nand both single-well and double well potentials are observed, the latter with a\nbroad spectrum of barrier heights. The appearance of glassy phases at low\ntemperatures is marked by the appearance of asymmetries in the distribution of\nsingle-site potentials, as previously observed for fully connected systems.\nDouble-well potentials with a broad spectrum of barrier heights and asymmetries\nwould give rise to the well known universal glassy low temperature anomalies\nwhen quantum effects are taken into account.\n"

We apply this method to the Gross-Pitaevskii\nmodel, and derive a simple formula for the vortex mass. We study both the long\nrange and short range properties of the solution. We agree with earlier results\nthat the non-zero compressibility leads to a divergent mass. From the\nshort-range behavior of the solution we find that the mass is sensitive to the\nform of the pinning potential, and diverges logarithmically when the radius of\nthis potential tends to zero.\n"

The local roughness, measured as a function of window\nsize r, shows a crossover at a characteristic length r_c, from a rapid increase\nwith exponent \\alpha_1 to a slower increase with exponent \\alpha_2. The result\n\\alpha_1\\approx 1 is explained by the large height differences in the borders\nof the grains when compared to intragrain roughness, and must not be\ninterpreted as a consequence of a diffusion dominated intragrain dynamics. This\nexponent shows a weak dependence on the shape and size distribution of the\ngrains, and typically ranges from 0.85 for rounded grain surfaces to 1 for the\nsharpest ones. The scaling corrections of exactly solvable models suggest the\npossibility of slightly smaller values due to other smoothing effects of the\nsurface images. The crossover length r_c provides a reasonable estimate of the\naverage grain size in all model systems, including the cases of wide grain size\ndistributions. In Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth, very different values of \\alpha_2\nare obtained, ranging from 0.4 for the films with smoothest surfaces to values\nin the range 0.1\\lesssim \\alpha_2 \\lesssim 0.2 for systems with large cliffs\nseparating the grains. Possible applications to real systems which show this\ncrossover with similar exponents are discussed.\n"

        "title-abstract": "Re-examining Bogoliubov's theory of an interacting Bose gas:   As is well-known, in the conventional formulation of Bogoliubov's theory of\nan interacting Bose gas, the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is written as a decoupled\nsum of contributions from different momenta of the form $\\hat{H} = \\sum_{k\\neq\n0}\\hat{H}_{k}$. Then, each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$ is\ndiagonalized separately, and the resulting ground state wavefunction of the\ntotal Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is written as a simple product of the ground state\nwavefunctions of each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$. We argue\nthat, from a number-conserving perspective, this diagonalization method may not\nbe adequate since the true Hilbert spaces where the Hamiltonians\n${\\hat{H}_{k}}$ should be diagonalized all have the ${k}=0$ state in common,\nand hence the ground state wavefunction of the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ may\n{not} be written as a simple product of the ground state wavefunctions of the\n$\\hat{H}_{k}$'s. In this paper, we give a thorough review of Bogoliubov's\nmethod, and discuss a variational and number-conserving formulation of this\ntheory in which the ${k}=0$ state is restored to the Hilbert space of the\ninteracting gas, and where, instead of diagonalizing the Hamiltonians\n$\\hat{H}_{k}$ separately, we diagonalize the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ as a\nwhole. When this is done, we find that the ground state energy is lowered below\nthe Bogoliubov result, and the depletion of bosons is significantly reduced\nwith respect to the one obtained in the number non-conserving treatment. We\nalso find that the spectrum of the usual $\\alpha_{k}$ excitations of\nBogoliubov's method changes from a gapless one, as predicted by the standard,\nnumber non-conserving formulation of this theory, to one which exhibits a\nfinite gap in the $k\\to 0$ limit.\n"

We study a two dimensional case where a thin strip of solid, created\nin this way, is surrounded on either side by a bath of liquid with which it can\neasily exchange particles. Since height fluctuations of the interface cost\nenergy, this interface is constrained to remain flat at all length scales.\nHowever, when such a solid is stressed by altering the depth of the potential;\nbeyond a certain limit, it responds by relieving stress by novel interfacial\nfluctuations which involve addition or deletion of entire lattice layers of the\ncrystal. This ``layering'' transition is a generic feature of the system\nregardless of the details of the interaction potential. We show how such\ninterfacial fluctuations influence mass, momentum and energy transport across\nthe interface. Tiny momentum impulses produce weak shock waves which travel\nthrough the interface and cause the spallation of crystal layers into the\nliquid. Kinetic and energetic constraints prevent spallation of partial layers\nfrom the crystal, a fact which may be of some practical use. We also study heat\ntransport through the liquid-solid interface and obtain the resistances in\nliquid, solid and interfacial regions (Kapitza resistance) as the solid\nundergoes such layering transitions. Heat conduction, which shows strong\nsignatures of the structural transformations, can be understood using a free\nvolume calculation.\n"

In the context of a simple\nmeasurement model, we derive analytic expressions for the flux induced by the\nfeedback ratchet when acting on one particle and a few particles, and compare\nthese results with those obtained with its open-loop version, which operates\nwithout information. Our main finding is that the flux in the feedback case has\nan upper bound proportional to the square-root of the information. Our results\nprovide a quantitative analysis of the value of information in feedback\nratchets, as well as an effective description of imperfect or noisy feedback\nratchets that are relevant for experimental applications.\n"

These models mimic anisotropic\ngeometry deformations and mass diffusion occuring in the QR fabrication\nprocess. Symmetry considerations and simplified analytical models supply\nphysical insight into the obtained numerical results. Our study demonstrates\nthat, except for unusual extremely large eccentricities, QR geometry\ndeformations only appreciably influence a few low-lying states, while the\neffect of barriers disturbing the QR persistent current is stronger and affects\nall studied states to a similar extent. We also show that the response of the\nelectron states to in-plane magnetic fields provides accurate information on\nthe structural anisotropy.\n"

In the case of metals, the\nconditions of material ejection from the surface are discussed in a\nhydrodynamic context, allowing correlation of the thermodynamic features with\nablation mechanisms. A convenient synthetic representation of the thermodynamic\nprocesses is presented, emphasizing different competitive pathways of material\nejection.

An estimation of the amount of material\nexceeding the specific energy required for melting is reported for copper and\naluminum and a theoretical value of the limit-size of the recast material after\nultrashort laser irradiation is determined. Ablation by mechanical\nfragmentation is also analysed and compared to experimental data for aluminum\nsubjected to high tensile pressures and ultrafast loading rates.

The process involves hard core particles\nundergoing stochastic driven dynamics on a lattice. The variance of the\ndisplacement of the tagged particle, averaged with respect to an initial\nstationary ensemble and stochastic evolution, grows linearly with time at both\nsmall and very large times. We find that at intermediate times, it shows\noscillations with a well defined size-dependent period. These oscillations\narise from sliding density fluctuations (SDF) in the stationary state with\nrespect to the drift of the tagged particle, the density fluctuations being\ntransported through the system by kinematic waves. In the general context of\ndriven diffusive systems, both the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) and the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fixed points are unstable with respect to the SDF\nfixed point, a flow towards which is generated on adding a gradient term to the\nEW and the KPZ time-evolution equation. We also study tagged particle\ncorrelations for a fixed initial configuration, drawn from the stationary\nensemble, following earlier work by van Beijeren. We find that the time\ndependence of this correlation is determined by the dissipation of the density\nfluctuations. We show that an exactly solvable linearized model captures the\nessential qualitative features seen in the finite size effects of the tagged\nparticle correlations in the ASEP. Moreover, this linearized model also\nprovides an exact coarse-grained description of two other microscopic models.\n"

Emphasis is given to realistic pulse delays and the long-time\nlimit, beyond the domain where available analytical approaches are guaranteed\nto work. Our results show that both deterministic and randomized protocols are\ncapable to significantly prolong the electron coherence time, even when using\ncontrol pulse separations substantially larger than what expected from the {\\em\nupper cutoff} frequency of the coupling spectrum between the electron and the\nnuclear spins. In a realistic parameter range, the {\\em total width} of such a\ncoupling spectrum appears to be the physically relevant frequency scale\naffecting the overall quality of the decoupling.\n"

Dion, H. Rydberg, E. Schroder, D. C.\nLangreth, and B. I. Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. We use this\npotential for a self-consistent calculation of the ground state properties of a\nnumber of van der Waals complexes as well as crystalline silicon. For the\nlatter, where little or no van der Waals interaction is expected, we find that\nthe results are mostly determined by semilocal exchange and correlation as in\nstandard generalized gradient approximations (GGA), with the fully nonlocal\nterm giving little effect. On the other hand, our results for the van der Waals\ncomplexes show that the self-consistency has little effect at equilibrium\nseparations. This finding validates previous calculations with the same\nfunctional that treated the fully nonlocal term as a post GGA perturbation. A\ncomparison of our results with wave-function calculations demonstrates the\nusefulness of our approach. The exchange-correlation potential also allows us\nto calculate Hellmann-Feynman forces, hence providing the means for efficient\ngeometry relaxations as well as unleashing the potential use of other standard\ntechniques that depend on the self-consistent charge distribution. The nature\nof the van der Waals bond is discussed in terms of the self-consistent bonding\ncharge.\n"

An unconventional universality deeply affected by the\ntopological nature of Lifshitz-type transitions emerges around the marginal\nquantum critical point (MQCP). Here the MQCP is defined by the meeting point of\nthe finite temperature critical line and a quantum critical line running on the\nzero temperature plane. The MQCP offers a marked contrast with the Ising\nuniversality and the gas-liquid-type criticality satisfied for conventional\nmetamagnetic transitions. At the MQCP, the inverse magnetic susceptibility\nchi^-1 has diverging slope as a function of the magnetization m (namely, | d\nchi^-1/d m | -> infty) in one side of the transition, which should not occur in\nany conventional quantum critical phenomena. The exponent of the divergence can\nbe estimated even at finite temperatures. We propose that such an\nunconventional universality indeed accounts for the metamagnetic transition in\nZrZn_2.\n"

The shape of $\\Emin (p)$ suggests that the quantum well becomes phase\nseparated with regions containing low hole concentrations and perpendicular\nmoments interspersed with other regions containing high hole concentrations and\nparallel moments. However, due to the Coulomb energy cost associated with phase\nseparation, the true magnetic state in the transition region is canted with $0\n< \\theta < \\pi /2$.\n"

Using a many-body functional integral formalism,\nthe Gaussian fluctuations give rise to an induced dimer-dimer interaction\nmediated by the unpaired fermions, with the dimer-fermion vertex being given by\nthe (mean-field) Born approximation. Treating the pairing fluctuations to\nquartic order, we show how the action for a spin-polarized Fermi superfluid\nreduces to one for a Bose-Fermi mixture. This Bose-Fermi action includes an\nexpression for the effective dimer-unpaired fermion interaction in a\nspin-polarized Fermi superfluid beyond the Born approximation, in the\nsuperfluid phase at finite temperatures. In the low-density limit, we show how\nthis dimer-fermion interaction gives the s-wave scattering length\n$a_{BF}=1.18a_F$ ($a_F$ is the s-wave fermion scattering length), a result\nfirst derived by Skorniakov and Ter-Martirosian in 1957 for three interacting\nfermions.\n"

The spin relaxation occurs due to a combined effect\nof the spin-orbit, Zeeman, and electron-phonon interactions. The\nsinglet-triplet relaxation rates exhibit strong variations as a function of the\nsinglet-triplet splitting. We show that the Coulomb interaction between the\nelectrons has two competing effects on the singlet-triplet spin relaxation. One\neffect is to enhance the relative strength of spin-orbit coupling in the\nquantum dot, resulting in larger spin-orbit splittings and thus in a stronger\ncoupling of spin to charge. The other effect is to make the charge density\nprofiles of the singlet and triplet look similar to each other, thus\ndiminishing the ability of charge environments to discriminate between singlet\nand triplet states. We thus find essentially different channels of\nsinglet-triplet relaxation for the case of strong and weak Coulomb interaction.\nFinally, for the linear in momentum Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit\ninteractions, we calculate the singlet-triplet relaxation rates to leading\norder in the spin-orbit interaction, and find that they are proportional to the\nsecond power of the Zeeman energy, in agreement with recent experiments on\ntriplet-to-singlet relaxation in quantum dots.\n"

This is probably due to the leakage of d-electrons at\ninterfaces from the Mott insulator LaTiO3 to the band insulator SrTiO3.

We find that the nonequilibrium magnetization dynamics is\ngoverned by a stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation with spin transfer\ntorques. We calculate the Gilbert damping parameter $\\alpha$ and the\nnon-adiabatic spin transfer torque parameter $\\beta$ for a model ferromagnet.\nWe find that $\\beta \\neq \\alpha$, in agreement with the results obtained using\nimaginary-time methods of Kohno, Tatara and Shibata [J. Phys. Soc. Japan 75,\n113706 (2006)]. We comment on the relationship between $s-d$ and\nisotropic-Stoner toy models of ferromagnetism and more realistic\ndensity-functional-theory models, and on the implications of these\nrelationships for predictions of the $\\beta/\\alpha$ ratio which plays a central\nrole in domain wall motion. Only for a single-parabolic-band isotropic-Stoner\nmodel with an exchange splitting that is small compared to the Fermi energy\ndoes $\\beta/\\alpha$ approach one. In addition, our microscopic formalism\nincorporates naturally the fluctuations needed in a nonzero-temperature\ndescription of the magnetization. We find that to first order in the applied\nelectric field, the usual form of thermal fluctuations via a phenomenological\nstochastic magnetic field holds.\n"

In order to exploit this potential, the fundamental\nbottleneck of poor light-SPP coupling must be overcome. In established SPP\nsources (using prism, grating} or nanodefect coupling) incident light is a\nsource of noise for the SPP, unless the illumination occurs away from the\nregion of interest, increasing the system size and weakening the SPP intensity.\nBack-side illumination of subwavelength apertures in optically thick metal\nfilms eliminates this problem but does not ensure a unique propagation\ndirection for the SPP. We propose a novel back-side slit-illumination method\nbased on drilling a periodic array of indentations at one side of the slit. We\ndemonstrate that the SPP running in the array direction can be suppressed, and\nthe one propagating in the opposite direction enhanced, providing localized\nunidirectional SPP launching.\n"

A new\nnetwork structure parameter, loopiness coefficient, is introduced to\nquantitatively study the loop effect on network dynamics. The large loopiness\ncoefficient means the large probability of finding loops in the networks. We\ndevelop the recursive equations for the overlap parameters of neural networks\nin the term of the loopiness. It was found that the large loopiness increases\nthe correlations among the network states at different times, and eventually it\nreduces the performance of neural networks. The theory is applied to several\nnetwork topological structures, including fully-connected, densely-connected\nrandom, densely-connected regular, and densely-connected small-world, where\nencouraging results are obtained.\n"

This is shown to be directly related to a\ndecay in time of the excess monomer density near the pore as\n$t^{-(1+\\nu)/(1+2\\nu)}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{R})$. Beyond the Rouse time translocation\nbecomes diffusive. In consequence of this, the dwell-time $\\tau_{d}$, the time\na translocating polymer typically spends within the pore, scales as\n$N^{2+\\nu}$, in contrast to previous claims.\n"

        "title-abstract": "Phase transitions and configuration space topology:   Equilibrium phase transitions may be defined as nonanalytic points of\nthermodynamic functions, e.g., of the canonical free energy. Given a certain\nphysical system, it is of interest to understand which properties of the system\naccount for the presence of a phase transition, and an understanding of these\nproperties may lead to a deeper understanding of the physical phenomenon. One\npossible approach of this issue, reviewed and discussed in the present paper,\nis the study of topology changes in configuration space which, remarkably, are\nfound to be related to equilibrium phase transitions in classical statistical\nmechanical systems. For the study of configuration space topology, one\nconsiders the subsets M_v, consisting of all points from configuration space\nwith a potential energy per particle equal to or less than a given v. For\nfinite systems, topology changes of M_v are intimately related to nonanalytic\npoints of the microcanonical entropy (which, as a surprise to many, do exist).\nIn the thermodynamic limit, a more complex relation between nonanalytic points\nof thermodynamic functions (i.e., phase transitions) and topology changes is\nobserved. For some class of short-range systems, a topology change of the M_v\nat v=v_t was proved to be necessary for a phase transition to take place at a\npotential energy v_t. In contrast, phase transitions in systems with long-range\ninteractions or in systems with non-confining potentials need not be\naccompanied by such a topology change. Instead, for such systems the\nnonanalytic point in a thermodynamic function is found to have some\nmaximization procedure at its origin. These results may foster insight into the\nmechanisms which lead to the occurrence of a phase transition, and thus may\nhelp to explore the origin of this physical phenomenon.\n"

It is known that for one-dimensional quantum systems, spontaneous\nbreakdown of continuous symmetries is generally forbidden. Any vector chiral\norder hence does not appear in spin-rotationally [SU(2)]-symmetric spin\nladders. However, if a magnetic field is added along the S^z axis of ladders\nand the SU(2) symmetry is reduced to the U(1) one, the z component of a vector\nchiral order can emerge with the remaining U(1) symmetry unbroken. Making use\nof Abelian bosonization techniques, we actually show that a certain type of\nfour-spin exchange can yield a vector chiral long-range order in spin-1/2 and\nspin-1 ladders under a magnetic field. In the chiral-ordered phase, the Z_2\ninterchain-parity (i.e., chain-exchange) symmetry is spontaneously broken. We\nalso consider effects of perturbations breaking the parity symmetry.\n"

The latter makes graphene a promising\nmaterial for future electronics and the recently demonstrated possibility of\nchemical doping without significant change in mobility has improved graphene's\nprospects further [13]. However, to find optimal dopants and, more generally,\nto progress towards graphene-based electronics requires understanding the\nphysical mechanism behind the chemical doping, which has been lacking so far.\nHere, we present the first joint experimental and theoretical investigation of\nadsorbates on graphene. We elucidate a general relation between the doping\nstrength and whether or not adsorbates have a magnetic moment: The paramagnetic\nsingle NO2 molecule is found to be a strong acceptor, whereas its diamagnetic\ndimer N2O4 causes only weak doping. This effect is related to the peculiar\ndensity of states of graphene, which provides an ideal situation for model\nstudies of doping effects in semiconductors. Furthermore, we explain recent\nresults on its \"chemical sensor\" properties, in particular, the possibility to\ndetect a single NO2 molecule [13].\n"

We show that a\nspin-degeneracy of the conductance channels is lifted and the total conductance\nexhibits a broad plateau-like feature at 0.5*2e^{2}/h. The lifting of the\nspin-degeneracy is a generic feature of all studied QPC structures (both very\nshort and very long ones; with the lengths in the range 40<l<500 nm). The\ncalculated conductance also shows a hysteresis for forward- and backward sweeps\nof the gate voltage. These features in the conductance can be traced to the\nformation of weakly coupled quasi-bound states (magnetic impurities) inside the\nQPC (also predicted in previous DFT-based studies). A comparison of obtained\nresults with the experimental data shows however, that while the spin-DFT based\n\"first-principle\" calculations exhibits the spin polarization in the QPC, the\ncalculated conductance clearly does not reproduce the 0.7 anomaly observed in\nalmost all QPCs of various geometries. We critically examine major features of\nthe standard DFT-based approach to the conductance calculations and argue that\nits inability to reproduce the 0.7 anomaly might be related to the infamous\nderivative discontinuity problem of the DFT leading to spurious\nself-interaction errors not corrected in the standard LDA. Our results indicate\nthat the formation of the magnetic impurities in the QPC might be an artefact\nof the LDA when localization of charge is expected to occur. We thus argue that\nan accurate description of the QPC structure would require approaches that go\nbeyond the standard DFT+LDA schemes.\n"

For finite systems, each saddle point is found to cause a\nnonanalyticity in the Boltzmann entropy, and the functional form of this\nnonanalytic term is derived. For large systems, the order of the nonanalytic\nterm increases unboundedly, leading to an increasing differentiability of the\nentropy. Analyzing the contribution of the saddle points to the density of\nstates in the thermodynamic limit, our results provide an explanation of how,\nand under which circumstances, saddle points of the potential energy landscape\nmay (or may not) be at the origin of a phase transition in the thermodynamic\nlimit. As an application, the puzzling observations by Risau-Gusman et al. on\ntopological signatures of the spherical model are elucidated.\n"

The system possesses phases with a\nlocalized shock in the density profile in one of the lanes, similarly to\nexclusion processes endowed with nonconserving kinetics in the bulk. Besides,\nthe system undergoes a discontinuous phase transition, where coherently moving\ndelocalized shocks emerge in both lanes and the fluctuation of the global\ndensity is described by an unbiased random walk. This phenomenon is analogous\nto the phase coexistence observed at the coexistence line of the totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process, however, as a consequence of the\ninteraction between lanes, the density profiles are deformed and in the case of\nasymmetric lane change, the motion of the shocks is confined to a limited\ndomain.\n"

It provides unexpected bridge between\ncondensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics (QED).

For external fields applied parallel to the in-plane easy\naxis, the layer-by-layer configuration, calculated in the framework of a\nmean-field one-dimensional model, was benchmarked against published polarized\nneutron reflectivity data. For an in-plane field $H$ applied at an angle $\\psi\n\\ne 0$ with the easy axis, magnetometry shows that the magnetization $M$\nvanishes at H=0, then increases slowly with increasing $H$. At a critical value\nof $H$, a finite jump in $M(H)$ is observed for $\\psi<5^{\\rm o}$, while a\nsmooth increase of $M$ $vs$ $H$ is found for $\\psi>5^{\\rm o}$. A dramatic\nincrease in the full width at half maximum of the magnetic susceptibility is\nobserved for $\\psi \\ge 5^{\\rm o}$.

It is\nshown that the linear invariant eigenfunction can be realized as a\nGaussian-type wave packet with a peak moving along the classical angular\ntrajectory, while the distribution of the wave packet is determined by the\nratio of the coefficient of the initial angle to that of the initial canonical\nangular momentum. From the topologically nontrivial nature as well as the\nclassical trajectory and angular momentum, one can determine the dynamical\nmotion of the wave packet. It should be noted that the peak position is no\nlonger an expectation value of the angle operator, and hence the Ehrenfest\ntheorem is not directly applicable in such a topologically nontrivial system.\n"

There is a practical\ngap between microscopic forms of FT and mesoscopic (i.e. not purely\nHamiltonian) forms for open systems. In a microscopic setup, it is easy to\nstate and to prove FT. In a mesoscopic setup, it is difficult to identify\nfluctuations of the entropy production. (This difficulty is absent in the\nclassical case.) We discuss a particular mesoscopic model: a Lindblad master\nequation, in which we state FT and, more importantly, connect it rigorously\nwith the underlying microscopic FT. We also remark that FT is satisfied by the\nLesovik-Levitov formula for statistics of charge transport.\n"

Using the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group method to investigate the Hubbard model at\nvarious fillings and interactions, we confirm that the shot noise contains full\ninformation on the correlations present in the system. We point out the\nimportance of the sum rules fulfilled by the noise correlations and show that\nthey yield nonsingular structures beyond the predictions of bosonization\napproaches. Noise correlations can thus serve as a universal probe of order and\ncan be used to characterize the many-body states of cold atoms in optical\nlattices.\n"

We mostly concentrate on a\nsetup consisting of a qubit and three independent detectors that simultaneously\nmonitor three noncommuting operator variables, those corresponding to three\npseudospin components of the qubit. We address the joint probability\ndistribution of the detector outcomes and the qubit variables. When analyzing\nthe distribution in the limit of big values of the outcomes, we reveal a high\ndegree of correspondence between the three outcomes and three components of the\nqubit pseudospin after the measurement. This enables a high-fidelity monitoring\nof all three components. We discuss the relation between the monitoring\ndescribed and the algorithms of quantum information theory that use the results\nof the partial measurement. We develop a proper formalism to evaluate the\nstatistics of continuous weak linear measurement. The formalism is based on\nFeynman-Vernon approach, roots in the theory of full counting statistics, and\nboils down to a Bloch-Redfield equation augmented with counting fields.\n"

As the ratio between\nthe number of reactions and that of reagents increases the system passes from a\ncontracting (r<1) to an expanding regime (r>1). These results extend the\nscenario derived in the fully connected model ($D\\to\\infinity$), with the\nimportant difference that, generically, larger growth rates are achievable in\nthe expanding phase for finite D and in more diluted networks. Moreover, the\nrange of attainable values of r shrinks as the connectivity increases.\n"

Our\ninvestigation shows that the total system realizes a solid state based\narchitecture for cavity QED. Exchanging such kind effective boson in a virtual\nprocess can result in an effective interaction between two spins. It is\ndiscovered that a maximum entangled state can be obtained when the velocity of\nthe electrons matches the initial distance between them in a suitable way.\nMoreover, we also study how the number of collective excitations influences the\nentanglement. It is shown that the larger the number of excitation is, the less\nthe two spins entangle each other.\n"

        "title-abstract": "Peltier effects in Andreev interferometers:   The superconducting proximity effect is known to modify transport properties\nof hybrid normal--superconducting structures. In addition to changing\nelectrical and thermal transport separately, it alters the thermoelectric\neffects. Changes to one off-diagonal element $L_{12}$ of the thermoelectric\nmatrix $L$ have previously been studied via the thermopower, but the remaining\ncoefficient $L_{21}$ which is responsible for the Peltier effect has received\nless attention. We discuss symmetry relations between $L_{21}$ and $L_{12}$ in\naddition to the Onsager reciprocity, and calculate Peltier coefficients for a\nspecific structure. Similarly as for the thermopower, for finite phase\ndifferences of the superconducting order parameter, the proximity effect\ncreates a Peltier effect significantly larger than the one present in purely\nnormal-metal structures. This results from the fact that a nonequilibrium\nsupercurrent carries energy.\n"

We\ndevelop an exact diagonalization approach to the coupling between\ncenter-of-mass and relative motion and numerically determine the spectrum of\nthe system. At the same time, our approach allows us to treat the anharmonicity\nof the lattice potential exactly.

Since the energy-uncertainty of the edge\nstate is larger than temperature, we conclude that the single-particle picture\nof the edge state in not appropriate when the electron-phonon interaction is\ntaken into account.

In this work we study a setting where relaxation to a steady state\nis exact, namely for the Bose-Hubbard model where the system is quenched from a\nMott quantum phase to the strong superfluid regime. We find that the evolving\nstate locally relaxes to a steady state with maximum entropy constrained by\nsecond moments, maximizing the entanglement, to a state which is different from\nthe thermal state of the new Hamiltonian. Remarkably, in the infinite system\nlimit this relaxation is true for all large times, and no time average is\nnecessary. For large but finite system size we give a time interval for which\nthe system locally \"looks relaxed\" up to a prescribed error. Our argument\nincludes a central limit theorem for harmonic systems and exploits the finite\nspeed of sound. Additionally, we show that for all periodic initial\nconfigurations, reminiscent of charge density waves, the system relaxes\nlocally.

If the atoms are modeled by a quantum field\ntheory with an atom field only, condensates of dimers cannot be described by\nthe mean-field approximation because there is no field associated with the\ndimers. We develop a method for describing dimer condensates in such a model\nbased on the one-particle-irreducible (1PI) effective action. We construct an\nequivalent 1PI effective action that depends not only on the classical atom\nfield but also on a classical dimer field. The method is illustrated by\napplying it to the many-body behavior of bosonic atoms with large scattering\nlength at zero temperature using an approximation in which the 2-atom amplitude\nis treated exactly but irreducible $N$-atom amplitudes for $N \\ge 3$ are\nneglected. The two 1PI effective actions give identical results for the atom\nsuperfluid phase, but the one with a classical dimer field is much more\nconvenient for describing the dimer superfluid phase. The results are also\ncompared with previous work on the Bose gas near a Feshbach resonance.\n"

In particular, we consider the relaxation of the system when the metric\ntensor (i.e. the Onsager matrix) is constant and when the Onsager coefficients\nweakly depend on the spatial derivatives of the concentrations. We show that,\nto leading order, during the relaxation towards a steady-state, the system\ntraces out a geodesic in the space of thermodynamic configurations, in\naccordance with the MRDP.\n"

Since it was expected that the PG-normal state for these\nmaterials, as for conventional superconductors, is conducting. This MIC,\nrevealed in such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz\nratio, insulator resistivity boundary, nonlinear entropy, resistivity\ntemperature upturn, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and\nFermi pockets, unambiguously indicates on the insulating normal state, from\nwhich the high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) appears. In the present work\n(article I), we discuss the MIC phenomena mentioned in the title of article.\nThe second work (article II) will be devoted to discussion of other listed\nabove MIC phenomena and also to interpretation of the recent observations in\nthe hidden magnetic order and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments\nspin and charge fluctuations as the intra PG and HTS pair ones. We find that\nall these MIC (called in the literature as non-Fermi liquid) phenomena can be\nobtained within the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model,\nwhich we recently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of single fermions into\nthose of single bosons. We show that this MIC originates from bosons of Coulomb\ntwo liquid model and fermions, whose origin is these bosons. At an increase of\ndoping up to critical value or temperature up to PG boundary temperature, the\nboson system undegoes bosonic insulator - bosonic metal - fermionic metal\ntransitions.\n"

From the detailed analysis of the specific heat and a\ncomparison with ab-initio electronic structure calculations, a quantitative\nestimate of the electron-phonon coupling strength and the logarithmic average\nphonon frequency is made. The electron-phonon coupling constant is determined\nto \\lambda ~ 1.35. The electron-phonon coupling to low energy phonon modes is\nfound to be the leading mechanism for the superconductivity. Our results\nsuggest that La2C3 is in the strong coupling regime, and the relevant phonon\nmodes are La-related rather than C-C stretching modes. The upper critical field\nshows a clear enhancement with respect to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg\nprediction, consistent with strong electron-phonon coupling.

Lastly, we note that neither of them conforms to the\nShore-Johnson theorem which is satisfied by Kullback-Leibler entropy and one of\nthe Tsallis relative entropies.\n"

In particular, the width of one\nstrongly coupled level may be larger than the spacing between other, very\nnarrow, levels. We found that in this case many consecutive Coulomb blockade\npeaks are due to occupation of the same broad level. Between the peaks the\nelectron jumps from this level to one of the narrow levels and the transmission\nthrough the dot at the next resonance essentially repeats that at the previous\none. This offers a natural explanation of the salient features of the behavior\nof the transmission phase in an interferometer with a QD. The theory of this\neffect will be reviewed with special emphasis on the role of the interactions.\nNew results on the dot-charging measurements and the fine structure of\noccupation switchings will be presented, accompanied by the unified description\nof the whole series of CB peaks caused by a single broad level. We then discuss\nthe case where the system approaches the Kondo regime.\n"

These more realistic potentials introduce features that can mask\nthe predicted Efimov physics at small scattering lengths. They also allow us to\nverify that positive and negative scattering lengths are universally connected\nonly across a pole, not across a zero. Additionally, we show that the spacing\nbetween Efimov features for the relatively small scattering lengths accessible\nexperimentally fail to precisely follow the geometric progression expected for\nEfimov physics. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the short-range\nthree-body physics in determining the position of Efimov features and show that\ntheoretically reproducing two-body physics is not generally sufficient to\npredict three-body properties quantitatively.\n"

The coupling between\nexcitons is due to interaction between the gradient of electric field induced\nby DCM2 Frenkel exciton and the quadrupole moment of the $1S$ transition in the\ncuprous oxide. The specific choice of the organic allows us to use the\nmechanism of 'solid state solvation' to dynamically tune the WE and FE into\nresonance during time $\\approx 3.3 \\: ns$ (comparable with the big life time of\nthe WE) of the 'slow' phase of the solvation. The quadrupole-dipole hybrid\nutilizes the big oscillator strength of the FE along with the big lifetime of\nthe quadrupole exciton, unlike dipole-dipole hybrid exciton which utilizes big\noscillator strength of the FE and big radius of the dipole allowed WE. Due to\nstrong spatial dispersion and big mass of the quadrupole WE the hybridization\nis not masked by the kinetic energy or the radiative broadening. The lower\nbranch of the hybrid dispersion exhibits a pronounced minimum and may be used\nin applications. Also we investigate and report noticeable change in the\ncoupling due to a induced 'Stark effect' from the strong local electric field\nof the FE. We investigated the fine energy structure of the quantum well\nconfined ortho and para excitons in cuprous oxide.\n"

Our finding supports strongly\nthat (1) EuB$_6$ is a semimetal and (2) the exchange-driven band splitting is\nthe primary source of the drastic $\\rho(T)$ and $\\omega_{p}^{2}$ changes at T\n$<$ T$_{c}$.\n"

        "title-abstract": "D-wave correlated Critical Bose Liquids in two dimensions:   We develop a description of a new quantum liquid phase of interacting bosons\nin 2d which possesses relative D-wave two-body correlations and which we call a\nD-wave Bose Liquid (DBL). The DBL has no broken symmetries, supports gapless\nboson excitations residing on \"Bose surfaces\" in momentum space, and exhibits\npower law correlations with continuously variable exponents. While the DBL can\nbe constructed for bosons in the 2d continuum, the state only respects the\npoint group symmetries of the square lattice. On the lattice the DBL respects\nall symmetries and does not require a particular filling. But lattice effects\nallow a second distinct phase, a quasi-local variant which we call a D-wave\nLocal Bose Liquid (DLBL). Remarkably, the DLBL has short-range boson\ncorrelations and hence no Bose surfaces, despite sharing gapless excitations\nand other critical signatures with the DBL. Moreover, both phases are metals\nwith a resistance that vanishes as a power of the temperature. We establish\nthese results by constructing a class of many-particle wavefunctions for the\nDBL, which are time reversal invariant analogs of Laughlin's quantum Hall\nwavefunction for bosons at $\\nu=1/2$. A gauge theory formulation leads to a\nsimple mean field theory, and an N-flavor generalization enables incorporation\nof gauge field fluctuations to deduce the properties of the DBL/DLBL; various\nequal time correlation functions are in qualitative accord with the properties\ninferred from the wavefunctions. We also identify a promising Hamiltonian which\nmight manifest the DBL or DLBL, and perform a variational study comparing to\nother competing phases. We suggest how the DBL wavefunction can be generalized\nto describe an itinerant non-Fermi liquid phase of electrons on the square\nlattice with a no double occupancy constraint, a D-wave metal phase.\n"

In the hard\nparticle limit, the rheology conforms to Bagnold scaling, where the shear\nstress is quadratic in the strain rate. As the particles are made softer,\nhowever, we find significant deviations from Bagnold rheology; the material\nflows more like a viscous fluid. We attribute this change in the collective\nrheology of the material to subtle changes in the contact lifetime distribution\ninvolving the increasing lifetime and number of the long-lived contacts in the\nsofter particle systems.\n"

In this work, we go beyond mean-field and develop an essentially-exact\nmany-body theory for the propagation of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation of $N$ interacting identical bosons. In our theory, the time-dependent\nmany-boson wavefunction is written as a sum of permanents assembled from\northogonal one-particle functions, or orbitals, where {\\it both} the expansion\ncoefficients {\\it and} the permanents (orbitals) themselves are {\\it\ntime-dependent} and fully determined according to a standard time-dependent\nvariational principle. By employing either the usual Lagrangian formulation or\nthe Dirac-Frenkel variational principle we arrive at two sets of coupled\nequations-of-motion, one for the orbitals and one for the expansion\ncoefficients. The first set comprises of first-order differential equations in\ntime and non-linear integro-differential equations in position space, whereas\nthe second set consists of first-order differential equations with\ntime-dependent coefficients. We call our theory multi-configurational\ntime-dependent Hartree for bosons, or MCTDHB($M$), where $M$ specifies the\nnumber of time-dependent orbitals used to construct the permanents. Numerical\nimplementation of the theory is reported and illustrative numerical examples of\nmany-body dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates are provided and\ndiscussed.\n"

Based on a thorough analysis of molecular dynamics simulations on\nPEO with LiBF$_4$ the mechanisms of cation dynamics are characterised. Cation\njumps between polymer chains can be identified as renewal processes. This\nallows us to obtain an explicit expression for the lithium ion diffusion\nconstant D_{Li} by invoking polymer specific properties such as the Rouse\ndynamics. This extends previous phenomenological and numerical approaches. In\nparticular, the chain length dependence of D_{Li} can be predicted and compared\nwith experimental data.

The systems are modelled by a tight-binding\nHamiltonian and the transient currents are computed from the non-equilibrium\nGreen-Keldysh formalism. The numerical implementation is not restricted to weak\ncoupling to the leads and does not imply the wide-band limit assumption for the\nspectral width of the leads. As an application of the method we study in detail\nthe transient behavior and the charge dynamics in single and double quantum\ndots connected to leads by a step-like potential, but the method allows as well\nthe consideration of non-periodic potentials or short pulses. We show that when\nthe higher energy levels of the isolated system are located within the bias\nwindow of the leads the transient current approaches the steady state in a\nnon-oscillatory smooth fashion. At moderate coupling to the leads and fixed\nbias the transient acquires a step-like structure, the length of the steps\nincreasing with the system size. The number of levels inside a finite bias\nwindow can be tuned by a constant gate potential. We find also that the\ntransient behavior depends on the specific way of coupling the leads to the\nmesoscopic system.\n"

Applied to two dimensions we solve the MCT equations\nnumerically for monodisperse hard discs.

Quantities characterizing the\nlocal, cooperative 'cage motion' do not differ much for d=2 and d=3, and we\ne.g. find the Lindemann criterion for the localization length at the glass\ntransition. The final relaxation obeys the superposition principle, collapsing\nremarkably well onto a Kohlrausch law. The d=2 MCT results are in qualitative\nagreement with existing results from MC and MD simulations. The mean squared\ndisplacements measured experimentally for a quasi-two-dimensional binary system\nof dipolar hard spheres can be described satisfactorily by MCT for monodisperse\nhard discs over four decades in time provided the experimental control\nparameter Gamma (which measures the strength of dipolar interactions) and the\npacking fraction phi are properly related to each other.\n"

This has prompted an experimental push to study such states\nusing confined geometries where the statistics can be tested. We study the\ntransport properties of quantum point contacts (QPCs) fabricated on a\nGaAs/AlGaAs two dimensional electron gas that exhibits well-developed\nfractional quantum Hall effect, including at bulk filling fraction 5/2. We find\nthat a plateau at effective QPC filling factor 5/2 is identifiable in point\ncontacts with lithographic widths of 1.2 microns and 0.8 microns, but not 0.5\nmicrons. We study the temperature and dc-current-bias dependence of the 5/2\nplateau in the QPC, as well as neighboring fractional and integer plateaus in\nthe QPC while keeping the bulk at filling factor 3. Transport near QPC filling\nfactor 5/2 is consistent with a picture of chiral Luttinger liquid edge-states\nwith inter-edge tunneling, suggesting that an incompressible state at 5/2 forms\nin this confined geometry.\n"

As a typical example of such cases, the magnetic\nphase transition of the Ising-like Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the\nkagome lattice has been studied. There, a phase transition of the\ntwo-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising universality class occurs accompanying with\nthe uniform spontaneous magnetization. Because of the macroscopic degeneracy in\nthe ordered phase, the system is found to show an entropy-driven ordering\nprocess, which is quantitatively characterized by the number of ``weathervane\nloop''.

We show that due to this VHS the strong-coupling analysis\nof tunneling spectra in high-$T_c$ superconductors must be reconsidered.

We find that for a wide range\nof impurity parameters the impurity interaction V_{12} as a function of their\nseparation r oscillates with decaying amplitude between being attractive and\nrepulsive. For half-filling of the band and in a crossover regime between weak\nand strong impurities the interaction becomes purely attractive. For U=0 and\nindependent of the impurity strength the amplitude of the interaction energy\nfalls off as 1/r. For U>0 the decay for small separations and weak to\nintermediate impurities is governed by a U dependent exponent larger than -1,\nwhich crosses over to -1 for large r. The crossover scale depends on the\nimpurity strength and U. We present simple pictures which explain our results\nin the limits of weak and strong impurities. We finally also consider\nattractive interactions U<0.\n"

A comparative inelastic X-ray scattering and\n  Raman study:   We study anharmonic effects in MgB2 by comparing Inelastic X-ray and\nRamanscattering together with ab-initio calculations. Using high statistics and\nhigh q resolution measurements we show that the E2g mode linewidth is\nindependent of temperature along Gamma-A. We show, contrary to previous claims,\nthat the Raman-peak energy decreases as a function of increasing temperature, a\nbehaviour inconsistent with all the anharmonic ab-initio calculations of the\nE2g mode at Gamma available in literature. These findings and the excellent\nagreement between the X-ray measured and ab-initio calculated phonon spectra\nsuggest that anharmonicity is not the main mechanism determining the\ntemperature behaviour of the Raman-peak energy. The Raman E2g peak position and\nlinewidth can be explained by large dynamical effects in the phonon\nself-energy. In light of the present findings, the commonly accepted\nexplanation of the reduced isotope effect in terms of anharmonic effects needs\nto be reconsidered.\n"

The two models interact through a dissipative Stokesian term\nfirst introduced by Ahlrichs and D\\\"unweg [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 111}, 8225\n(1999)]. We show that our method correctly captures the static and dynamical\nproperties of polymer chains as predicted by the Zimm model. In particular, we\nshow that the static conformations are best described when the ratio\n$\\frac{\\sigma}{b}=0.6$, where $\\sigma$ is the Lennard-Jones length parameter\nand $b$ is the monomer bond length. We also find that the decay of the Rouse\nmodes' autocorrelation function is better described with an analytical\ncorrection suggested by Ahlrichs and D\\\"unweg. Our FH solver permits us to\ntreat the fluid equation of state and transport parameters as direct simulation\nparameters. The expected independence of the chain dynamics on various choices\nof fluid equation of state and bulk viscosity is recovered, while excellent\nagreement is found for the temperature and shear viscosity dependence of centre\nof mass diffusion between simulation results and predictions of the Zimm model.\nWe find that Zimm model approximations start to fail when the Schmidt number\n$Sc \\lessapprox 30$. Finally, we investigate the importance of fluid\nfluctuations and show that using the preaveraged approximation for the\nhydrodynamic tensor leads to around 3% error in the diffusion coefficient for a\npolymer chain when the fluid discretization size is greater than $50\\AA$.\n"

The MDC is defined by considering the\nsingle hole spectral function $A^<(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ as a function of $\\vec{k}$\nat a fixed frequency $\\omega$. We show the existence of a \\emph{kink} in this\ndispersion for the spin-rotationally invariant Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid at\nfinite temperature. In the repulsive regime where the charge velocity $v_{c}$\nis greater than the spin velocity $v_{s}$, the low frequency effective\nelectronic dispersion is linear in $\\vec{k}$ and follows a velocity $v_l$\nbetween the spin and charge velocities, $v_s < v_l < v_c$. The high frequency\npart (which is also linear in $\\vec{k}$) disperses with the charge velocity\n$v_c$. The energy scale of the crossover between the two velocities defines a\nkink, $E_{\\rm kink}$. In addition, the high energy dispersion extrapolates to\nthe Fermi energy at a wavevector $k_{ex} \\ne k_F$ which is shifted from the\nFermi wavevector. The presence of such a kink is measurable with, {\\em e.g.},\nangle-resolved photoemission experiments, and may be used to test for the\npresence of Luttinger liquid behavior in systems in which the separate\ncontributions from spin and charge to the MDC are not discernible due to strong\ninteractions or low experimental resolution.\n"

Stiff polymers, unlike their flexible counterparts, are highly\nanisotropic elastic objects. Similar to mechanical beams stiff polymers easily\ndeform in bending, while they are much stiffer with respect to tensile forces\n(``stretching''). Unlike in previous approaches, where network elasticity is\nderived from the stretching mode, our theory properly accounts for the soft\nbending response. A self-consistent effective medium approach is used to\ncalculate the macroscopic elastic moduli starting from a microscopic\ncharacterization of the deformation field in terms of ``floppy modes'' --\nlow-energy bending excitations that retain a high degree of non-affinity. The\nlength-scale characterizing the emergent non-affinity is given by the ``fiber\nlength'' $l_f$, defined as the scale over which the polymers remain straight.\nThe calculated scaling properties for the shear modulus are in excellent\nagreement with the results of recent simulations obtained in two-dimensional\nmodel networks. Furthermore, our theory can be applied to rationalize bulk\nrheological data in reconstituted actin networks.\n"

After then, the system can be cooled back to\nnear the base temperature within 3 hours. Due to these capabilities, it has a\nvariety of applications not only for cleavable materials but also for almost\nall conducting materials.

Here we present an ab-initio study of the\nelectron dynamics in nanojunctions which reveals that the latter indeed\nexhibits behavior quite similar to that of a classical fluid. In particular, we\nfind that a transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs with increasing\ncurrent, corresponding to increasing Reynolds numbers.

        "title-abstract": "Microwave photoconductivity of a 2D electron gas: Mechanisms and their\n  interplay at high radiation power:   We develop a systematic theory of microwave-induced oscillations in the\nmagnetoresistivity of a two-dimensional electron gas, focusing on the regime of\nstrongly overlapping Landau levels. At linear order in microwave power, two\nnovel mechanisms of the oscillations (``quadrupole'' and ``photovoltaic'') are\nidentified, in addition to those studied before (``displacement'' and\n``inelastic''). The quadrupole and photovoltaic mechanisms are shown to be the\nonly ones that give rise to oscillations in the nondiagonal part of the\nphotoconductivity tensor. In the diagonal part, the inelastic contribution\ndominates at moderate microwave power, while at elevated power the other\nmechanisms become relevant. We demonstrate the crucial role of feedback\neffects, which lead to a strong interplay of the four mechanisms in the\nnonlinear photoresponse and yield, in particular, a nonmonotonic power\ndependence of the photoconductivity, narrowing of the magnetoresonances, and a\nnontrivial structure of the Hall photoresponse. At ultrahigh power, all effects\nrelated to the Landau quantization decay due to a combination of the feedback\nand multiphoton effects, restoring the classical Drude conductivity.\n"

Cr$_2$MnZ (Z= P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds have 24\nvalence electrons per unit cell and calculations show that their total spin\nmoment is approximately zero for a wide range of lattice constants in agreement\nwith the Slater-Pauling behavior for ideal half-metals. Simultaneously, the\nspin magnetic moments of Cr and Mn atoms are antiparallel and the compounds are\nferrimagnets. Mean-field approximation is employed to estimate their Curie\ntemperature, which exceeds room temperature for the alloy with Sb. Our findings\nsuggest that Cr$_2$MnSb is the compound of choice for further experimental\ninvestigations. Contrary to the alloys mentioned above half-metallic\nantiferromagnetism is unstable in the case of the Cr$_2$FeZ (Z= Si, Ge, Sn)\nalloys.\n"

We\nobserve two different muon sites which we associate with muons located adjacent\nto the two inequivalent O sites. One site, presumed to be located in the\nCu-O-Cu superexchange path, exhibits a large increase in the frequency shift\nwith decreasing temperature which is unaffected by the singlet formation,\nindicating that the muon has locally broken the singlet bond. We have also\nperformed $\\mu$SR on single crystals of SrMg$_{0.05}$Cu$_{1.95}$(BO$_3$)$_2$,\nSr$_{0.96}$La$_{0.04}$Cu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, and\nSr$_{0.95}$Na$_{0.05}$Cu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. We have found that the frequency\nshifts of these doped samples are equivalent and contain three branches at low\ntemperatures. Two of these branches map on to the branches observed in the pure\nsample reasonably well and so we attribute the third branch to effect of the\ndopants. Specifically, this third branch represents the case when the muon sits\nat a site in the superexchange path lacking a corresponding singlet, due to it\nalready being broken as a result of doping. This then leads to the conclusion\nthat singlets are broken in this system when it is doped both in and out of the\nCuBO$_3$ planes.\n"

We observe that the entanglement decays\nas a result of the coupling to the nuclear environment and reaches a saturation\nvalue, which depends on the value of the exchange interaction difference $J=\\|\nJ_l-J_z\\|$ between the two spins and the strength of the applied external\nmagnetic field. We find that the entanglement exhibits a critical behavior\ncontrolled by the competition between the exchange interaction $J$ and the\nexternal magnetic field. The entanglement shows a quasi-symmetric behavior\nabove and below a critical value of the exchange interaction. It becomes more\nsymmetric as the external magnetic field increases. The entanglement reaches a\nlarge saturation value, close to unity, when the exchange interaction is far\nabove or below its critical value and a small one as it closely approaches the\ncritical value. Furthermore, we find that the decay rate profile of\nentanglement is linear when the exchange interaction is much higher or lower\nthan the critical value but converts to a power law and finally to a Gaussian\nas the critical value is approached from both directions. The dynamics of\nentanglement is found to be independent of the exchange interaction for\nisotropically coupled quantum dot.\n"

A prominent example of a class of\nmaterials falling into this category are ferromagnetic (III,Mn)V\nsemiconductors, in which ultrafast demagnetization has been recently observed.\nIn the proposed model light excitation heats up the population of carriers,\ntaking it out of equilibrium with the localized spins. This triggers the\nprocess of energy and angular momentum exchange between the two spin systems,\nwhich lasts for the duration of the energy relaxation of the carriers. We\nderive the Master equation for the density matrix of a localized spin\ninteracting with the hot carriers and couple it with a phenomenological\ntreatment of the carrier dynamics. We develop a general theory within the sp-d\nmodel and we apply it to the ferromagnetic semiconductors, taking into account\nthe valence band structure of these materials. We show that the fast spin\nrelaxation of the carriers can sustain the flow of polarization between the\nlocalized and itinerant spins leading to significant demagnetization of the\nlocalized spin system, observed in (III,Mn)V materials.\n"

Within the\nBoltzmann equation framework, we calculate corrections to the thermopower and\nconductance to the leading order in the interaction and in the length of wire\n$L$. We check explicitly that the three-particle collision rate is identically\nzero in the case of several integrable interaction potentials. In the general\n(non-integrable) case, we find a positive contribution to the thermopower to\nleading order in $L$. The processes giving rise to the correction involve\nelectron states deep in the Fermi sea. Therefore the correction follows an\nactivation law with the characteristic energy of the order of the Fermi energy\nfor the electrons in the wire.\n"

Since for pure quantum critical spin chains this\ncoefficient is fixed by the central charge of the associated conformal field\ntheory, the universal coefficient in the random case can be understood as an\neffective central charge. In this paper we calculate the entanglement entropy\nand effective central charge of the spin-1 random Heisenberg model in its\nrandom-singlet phase and also at the critical point at which the Haldane phase\nbreaks down. The latter is the first entanglement calculation for an\ninfinite-randomness fixed point that is not in the random-singlet universality\nclass. Our results are consistent with a c-theorem for flow between\ninfinite-randomness fixed points. The formalism we use can be generally applied\nto calculation of quantities that depend on the RG history in s>=1 random\nHeisenberg chains.\n"

However, the anisotropic nature of the nematic state\nat a macroscopic scale can be easily wiped out when domains of different\norientations of nematic order exist. We suggest that a spatial pattern of local\ndensity of states (LDOS) in the presence of a non-magnetic impurity can be a\ndirect probe of the nematic order. We study various patterns of LDOS across the\nquantum phase transition between the isotropic and nematic phases.

In nonlinear\n``induced-charge'' electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC electro-osmosis,\nseveral Volts $\\approx 100 k_BT/e$ are applied to the double layer, so the\ntheory breaks down and cannot explain many observed features. We argue that,\nunder such a large voltage, counterions ``condense'' near the surface, even for\ndilute bulk solutions. Based on simple models, we predict that the double-layer\ncapacitance decreases and the electro-osmotic mobility saturates at large\nvoltages, due to steric repulsion and increased viscosity of the condensed\nlayer, respectively. The former suffices to explain observed high frequency\nflow reversal in AC electro-osmosis; the latter leads to a salt concentration\ndependence of induced-charge flows comparable to experiments, although a\ncomplete theory is still lacking.\n"

We first consider the evolution of the system \"as a whole\" and\nshow that the evolution of the vorticity profile is due to resonances between\ndifferent orbits of the point vortices. The evolution stops when the profile of\nangular velocity becomes monotonic even if the system has not reached the\nstatistical equilibrium state (Boltzmann distribution). In that case, the\nsystem remains blocked in a sort of metastable state with a non standard\ndistribution. We also study the relaxation of a test vortex in a steady bath of\nfield vortices. The relaxation of the test vortex is described by a\nFokker-Planck equation involving a diffusion term and a drift term. The\ndiffusion coefficient, which is proportional to the density of field vortices\nand inversely proportional to the shear, usually decreases rapidly with the\ndistance. The drift is proportional to the gradient of the density profile of\nthe field vortices and is connected to the diffusion coefficient by a\ngeneralized Einstein relation. We study the evolution of the tail of the\ndistribution function of the test vortex and show that it has a front\nstructure. We also study how the temporal auto-correlation function of the\nposition of the test vortex decreases with time and find that it usually\nexhibits an algebraic behavior with an exponent that we compute analytically.\nWe mention analogies with other systems with long-range interactions.\n"

Some of these have previously been studied using very\ndifferent techniques, others are to our knowledge new. What becomes clear in\nour approach is that, except for capillary phenomena, these boundary conditions\nare not the manifestation of a local force balance, even if the concept of\nsurface stress is properly generalized. Hamiltonians containing higher order\nsurface derivatives are not just sensitive to boundary translations but also\nnotice changes in slope or even curvature. Both the necessity and the\nfunctional form of the corresponding additional contributions follow readily\nfrom our treatment.\n"

Appl. Phys. v30, 77, 1959]\nfor bulk substrates, in which curvature-driven mass transport and surface\ndeformation can occur by surface/volume diffusion and evaporation-condensation\nprocesses, with that of Spencer et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. v67, 26, 1991] to\ndescribe solid state transport in thin films under epitaxial strain. The model\nis applied to study the relative rate of solid state mass transport as compared\nto that of liquid phase dewetting in a thin film subjected to fast a thermal\npulse. Specifically, we have recently shown that multiple cycles of nanosecond\n(ns) pulsed laser melting and resolidification of ultrathin metal films on\namorphous substrates can lead to the formation of various types of spatially\nordered nanostructures [Phys. Rev. B, v75, 235439 (2007)]. The pattern\nformation has been attributed to the dewetting of the thin film by a\nhydrodynamic instability. In such experiments the film is in the solid state\nduring a substantial fraction of each thermal cycle. Results of a linear\nstability analysis based on the aforementioned model suggest that solid state\nmass transport has negligible effect on morphology changes of the surface.\nHence, surface deformation caused by liquid phase instabilities is rapidly\nquenched-in during the cooling phase. This deformed state is further evolved by\nsubsequent laser pulses. These results have implications to developing accurate\ncomputer simulations of thin film dewetting by energetic beams aimed at the\nmanufacturing of optically active nanoscale materials for applications\nincluding information processing, optical devices and solar energy harvesting.\n"

For transitions with an order parameter carrying\nspin, the damping of such oscillations is determined by the scaling dimension\nof the composite spin operator. For transitions with a spinless order parameter\nand gapped spin excitations, we demonstrate that the damping is determined by\nan associated quantum impurity problem of a localized spin excitation\ninteracting with the bulk critical modes. We present a renormalization group\nanalysis of the quantum impurity problem, and discuss the relationship of our\nresults to experiments on ultracold atoms in optical lattices.\n"

Using an effective spectral function of\nthe dissipative phonon bath, we evaluated the expectation values of the spin\ncomponents through the Bloch-Redfield theory. We show that due to a sharp bath\nresonance present in the effective spectral function, with typical energy much\nsmaller than the electronic confinement energy, the dissipative spin has a rich\ndynamical behavior that helps us to determine some features of the spin-bath\ncoupling. We also quantify the effects produced by the sharp bath resonance,\nand thus indicate the best regimes of operation in order to achieve the longest\nrelaxation times for the spin.\n"

In this context, we studied whether this physical\nmeaning can be given to R\\'{e}nyi relative entropy definition found in the\nliterature from a generalized thermostatistical point of view. We find that\nthis is possible only in the limit as $q$ approaches to 1. This shows that\nR\\'{e}nyi relative entropy has a physical (thermostatistical) meaning only when\nthe system can already be explained by ordinary Boltzmann-Gibbs\nthermostatistics. Moreover, this can be taken as an indication of R\\'{e}nyi\nentropy being an equilibrium entropy since any relative entropy definition is a\ntwo-probability generalization of the associated entropy definition. We also\nnote that this result is independent of the internal energy constraint\nemployed. Finally, we comment on the lack of foundation of R\\'{e}nyi relative\nentropy as far as its minimization (which is equivalent to the maximization of\nR\\'{e}nyi entropy) is considered in order to obtain a stationary equilibrium\ndistribution since R\\'{e}nyi relative entropy does not conform to Shore-Johnson\naxioms.\n"

Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for\nsuperconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at\noptimal working points, so-called \"sweet spots.\" This latter approach led to\nsignificant improvement of $T_2$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et\nal., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting\nqubit called the \"transmon.\" Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed\nto operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and\ncharging energy $E_J/E_C$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge\ndispersion decreases exponentially with $E_J/E_C$, while its loss in\nanharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a\ndrastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair\nbox and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient\nanharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full\nsystem shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other\nknown channels.\n"

AGN are known\nto inflate buoyant bubbles that supply mechanical power to the intracluster gas\n(ICM). High Reynolds number hydrodynamical simulations show that such bubbles\nget entirely disrupted within 100 Myr, as they rise in cluster atmospheres,\nwhich is contrary to observations. This artificial mixing has consequences for\nmodels trying to quantify the amount of heating and star formation in cool core\nclusters of galaxies. It has been suggested that magnetic fields can stabilize\nbubbles against disruption. We perform MHD simulations of fossil bubbles in the\npresence of tangled magnetic fields using the high order PENCIL code. We focus\non the physically-motivated case where thermal pressure dominates over magnetic\npressure and consider randomly oriented fields with and without maximum\nhelicity and a case where large scale external fields drape the bubble.We find\nthat helicity has some stabilizing effect. However, unless the coherence length\nof magnetic fields exceeds the bubble size, the bubbles are quickly shredded.\nAs observations of Hydra A suggest that lengthscale of magnetic fields may be\nsmaller then typical bubble size, this may suggest that other mechanisms, such\nas viscosity, may be responsible for stabilizing the bubbles. However, since\nFaraday rotation observations of radio lobes do not constrain large scale ICM\nfields well if they are aligned with the bubble surface, the draping case may\nbe a viable alternative solution to the problem. A generic feature found in our\nsimulations is the formation of magnetic wakes where fields are ordered and\namplified. We suggest that this effect could prevent evaporation by thermal\nconduction of cold Halpha filaments observed in the Perseus cluster.\n"

We present a simple and efficient method for\nincorporating constraints from CMB anisotropy data, and use it to derive\nconstraints on cosmic curvature and dark energy density as a free function of\ncosmic time using current data. We show that there are two CMB shift\nparameters, R=sqrt{\\Omega_m H_0^2} r(z_{CMB}) (scaled distance to\nrecombination) and l_a=\\pi r(z_{CMB})/r_s(z_{CMB})(angular scale of the sound\nhorizon at recombination), with measured values that are nearly uncorrelated\nwith each other. Allowing nonzero cosmic curvature, the three-year WMAP data\ngive R =1.71 +/- 0.03, l_a =302.5 +/- 1.2, and \\Omega_b h^2 = 0.02173 +/-\n0.00082, independent of the dark energy model. The corresponding bounds for a\nflat universe are R =1.70 +/- 0.03, l_a =302.2 +/- 1.2, and \\Omega_b h^2 =\n0.022 +/- 0.00082. We give the covariance matrix of (R, l_a, \\Omega_b h^2) from\nthe three-year WMAP data. We find that (R, l_a, \\Omega_b h^2) provide an\nefficient and intuitive summary of CMB data as far as dark energy constraints\nare concerned. Using current CMB, SN Ia, and BAO data, we find that dark energy\ndensity is consistent with a constant in cosmic time, with marginal deviations\nfrom a cosmological constant that may reflect current systematic uncertainties\nor true evolution in dark energy. A flat universe is allowed by current data:\n\\Omega_k=-0.006_{-0.012}^{+0.013}_{-0.025}^{+0.025} for w_X(z)=const., and\n\\Omega_k=-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.018}_{-0.032}^{+0.041} for w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)(68%\nand 95% C.L.).

We suggest here a new test that is valid at z\\simeq 0.\nIt is based on existing observational data, numerical simulations, and three\nwell known analytic models that evaluate the bias parameter b, the ratio of\ngalaxy to dark matter (DM) fluctuations. These analytic models are based on the\nphysical processes involved in the formation of stars and in the formation and\nmerging of galaxies. The value of b(z) obtained in each model is a function of\nthe DM growth factor D(z), which, in turn, is a function of the DE. We show\nthat the equations for b in all three analytic models can be reduced to the\nform of a known constant plus the term E[D(z=0)/D(z)]^{\\alpha}, where \\alpha=1\nor 2 and E is a free parameter. Using the value of b obtained by the 2dFGRS\nconsortium for the \\LambdaCDM model, to normalize E, we find that all three\nanalytic models predict b^2(0)=1\\pm 0.1 for all DE models. Numerical\nsimulations that evaluated b^2(0) for the \\LambdaCDM and CDM (\\Lambda=0) models\nalso obtained b^2(0)=1\\pm 0.1. Since this value of b^2(0) is indicated by\nnumerical simulations as well as by all three popular analytic models, which\nare normalized by the 2dFGRS consortium result for the \\LambdaCDM model, we\nsuggest the condition that b^2(0)=1\\pm 0.1 at z=0 as a new test for the\nviability of dark energy models. Thus, for a given observed galaxy fluctuation\nspectrum such as that of the 2dFGRS consortium, if the DM fluctuations are\ngreater or less than the galaxy fluctuations by more than 10%, the DE model can\nbe discarded.\n"

However, relatively recently, it was shown that the amplitude of the\ncurvature perturbations induced by the canonical scalar field can grow at\nsuper-Hubble scales if there is either a transition to fast roll inflation or\nif inflation is interrupted for some period of time. In this work, we extend\nthe earlier analysis to the case of a non-canonical scalar field described by\nthe Dirac-Born-Infeld action. With the help of a specific example, we show that\nthe amplitude of the tachyonic perturbations can be enhanced or suppressed at\nsuper-Hubble scales if there is a transition from slow roll to fast roll\ninflation. We also illustrate as to how the growth of the entropy perturbations\nduring the fast roll regime proves to be responsible for the change in the\namplitude of the curvature perturbations at super-Hubble scales. Furthermore,\nfollowing the earlier analysis for the canonical scalar field, we show that the\npower spectrum evaluated in the long wavelength approximation matches the exact\npower spectrum obtained numerically very well. Finally, we briefly comment on\nan application of this phenomenon.\n"

The growth\nof IMBHs may lead to the formation of DM overdensities called \"mini-spikes\",\nrecently proposed as ideal targets for indirect DM searches. Current\nground-based gamma-ray experiments, however, cannot search for these objects\ndue to their limited field of view, and it might be challenging to discriminate\nmini-spikes in the Milky Way from the many astrophysical sources that GLAST is\nexpected to observe. We show here that gamma-ray experiments can effectively\nsearch for IMBHs in the nearby Andromeda galaxy (also known as M31), where\nmini-spikes would appear as a distribution of point-sources, isotropically\ndistributed in a \\thickapprox 3^{\\circ} circle around the galactic center. For\na neutralino-like DM candidate with a mass m_{\\chi}=150 GeV, up to 20 sources\nwould be detected with GLAST (at 5\\sigma, in 2 months).

The multiband data clearly\nexhibit a heart-shaped morphology and show the multi-shell structure of the\nremnant. A thin brace-like shell on the south detected at 24 um is projected\noutside the radio border and confines the southern faint X-ray emission. The\nleading 24 um knot on the SE boundary appears to be partly surrounded by soft\nX-ray emitting gas. The mid-IR emission is dominated by the contribution of the\nshocked dust grains, which may have been partly destroyed by sputtering.\n"

Such\nmodels can provide perfect, adiabatic fluids which are stable even when the\npressure is negative, if the rigidity is sufficiently large, making them\nnatural candidates to describe the dark energy. In fact, if the medium is\nadiabatic and isotropic, they provide the most general description of\nlinearized perturbations. We derive the equations of motion and wave\npropagation speeds in the isotropic case. We point out that anisotropic models\ncan also be incorporated within the same formalism and that they are classified\nby the standard Bravais Lattices. We identify the adiabatic and isocurvature\nmodes allowed in both the scalar and vector sectors and discuss the predictions\nthey make for CMB and matter power spectra. We comment on the relationship\nbetween these models and other fluid-based approaches to dark energy, and\ndiscuss a possible microphysical manifestation of this class of models as a\ncontinuum description of defect-dominated scenarios.\n"

In this paper, we describe a new\nparallel three-dimensional code for simulations of special relativistic\nhydrodynamics (SRHD) using both spatially and temporally structured adaptive\nmesh refinement (AMR). We used the method of lines to discretize the SRHD\nequations spatially and a total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta scheme\nfor time integration. For spatial reconstruction, we have implemented piecewise\nlinear method (PLM), piecewise parabolic method (PPM), third order convex\nessentially non-oscillatory (CENO) and third and fifth order weighted\nessentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes. Flux is computed using either\ndirect flux reconstruction or approximate Riemann solvers including HLL,\nmodified Marquina flux, local Lax-Friedrichs flux formulas and HLLC. The AMR\npart of the code is built on top of the cosmological Eulerian AMR code {\\sl\nenzo}. We discuss the coupling of the AMR framework with the relativistic\nsolvers. Via various test problems, we emphasize the importance of resolution\nstudies in relativistic flow simulations because extremely high resolution is\nrequired especially when shear flows are present in the problem. We also\npresent the results of two 3d simulations of astrophysical jets: AGN jets and\nGRB jets. Resolution study of those two cases further highlights the need of\nhigh resolutions to calculate accurately relativistic flow problems.\n"

We show that the star formation-density relation observed\nlocally was reversed at z~1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased\nwith local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age.\nHierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium\nmodel) predicted such a reversal to occur only at only at earlier epochs (z>2)\nand at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z~1.016, containing\nX-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a\nVirgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of\ngalaxies increases with density at the ~1-2 Mpc scale. The SFR of z~1 galaxies\nis found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in\nthe observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/M*)\ndecreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which\nimplies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity\nof galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause\nfor this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies\n(LIRGs) at z~1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third\npresent a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided\ninto compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of\nmajor mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals. Reproducing the\nSFR-density relation at z ~ 1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a\ncorrect balance between mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.\n"

Currently, the most promising method to detect many\ndifferent WIMP candidates is the direct detection of the recoil energy\ndeposited in a low-background laboratory detector due to elastic WIMP-nucleus\nscattering. So far the usual procedure has been to predict the event rate of\ndirect detection of WIMPs based on some model(s) of the galactic halo. The aim\nof our work is to invert this process. That is, we study what future direct\ndetection experiment can teach us about the WIMP halo. As the first step we\nconsider a time-averaged recoil spectrum, assuming that no directional\ninformation exists. We develop a method to construct the (time-averaged)\none-dimensional velocity distribution function from this spectrum. Moments of\nthis function, such as the mean velocity and velocity dispersion of WIMPs, can\nalso be obtained directly from the recoil spectrum. The only input needed in\naddition to a measured recoil spectrum is the mass of the WIMP; no information\nabout the scattering cross section or WIMP density is required.\n"

This allows us to\nstudy the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in cloudy, vertically-stratified\ndisks. As in previous unstratified models, we find that thermal instability\ninteracts with MRI-driven turbulence and galactic shear to produce a network of\ncold, dense, filamentary clouds embedded in a warm diffuse ambient medium. This\nstructure strongly resembles the morphology of HI gas observed in the 21 cm\nline. There is significant thermally-unstable gas, but the density and\ntemperature distributions retain the twin peaks of the classical two-phase ISM.\nWe analyze the vertical distributions of density and various pressure terms,\nand address what supports the ISM vertically. Turbulent velocities of the cold\ngas increase as the cold mass fraction decreases, but are generally low ~1-3\nkm/s near the midplane; they increase to > 5 km/s at high z. Finally, we argue\nthat in the outer parts of galactic disks, MRI is likely able to prevent the\ndevelopment of self-gravitating instabilities and hence suppress star\nformation, even if cold gas is present.\n"

Analyzing unexploited ISO-SWS data, deriving the basic observational\nparameters of dust bands and comparing them with respect to those observed in\nother astronomical sources, we try to highlight the effect of environment on\ngrain chemistry and physic. We find strong amorphous silicate emission bands at\n10 micron and 18 micron in a large fraction of the sample. The analysis of the\n10 micron band, along with a direct comparison with several astronomical\nsources, reveals that silicate dust in symbiotic stars shows features between\nthe characteristic circumstellar environments and the interstellar medium. This\nindicates an increasing reprocessing of grains in relation to specific\nsymbiotic behavior of the objects. A correlation between the central wavelength\nof the 10 and 18 micron dust bands is found. By the modeling of IR spectral\nlines we investigate also dust grains conditions within the shocked nebulae.\nBoth the unusual depletion values and the high sputtering efficiency might be\nexplained by the formation of SiO moleculae, which are known to be a very\nreliable shock tracer. We conclude that the signature of dust chemical\ndisturbance due to symbiotic activity should be looked for in the outer,\ncircumbinary, expanding shells where the environmental conditions for grain\nprocessing might be achieved. Symbiotic stars are thus attractive targets for\nnew mid-infrared and mm observations.\n"

Its precise\nspatial scale has been forwarded as a rigid-rod ruler test for the space-time\ngeometry, and hence as a probe for tracking the evolution of Dark Energy.\nPercent-level shifts in the measured position can bias such a test and erode\nits power to constrain cosmology. This paper addresses some of the systematic\neffects that might induce shifts: namely non-linear corrections from matter\nevolution, redshift space distortions and biasing. We tackle these questions\nthrough analytic methods and through a large battery of numerical simulations,\nwith total volume of the order ~100[Gpc\\h]^3. A toy-model calculation shows\nthat if the non-linear corrections simply smooth the acoustic peak, then this\ngives rise to an `apparent' shifting to smaller scales. However if tilts in the\nbroad band power spectrum are induced then this gives rise to more pernicious\n`physical' shifts. Our numerical simulations show evidence of both: in real\nspace and at z=0, for the dark matter we find percent level shifts; for haloes\nthe shifts depend on halo mass, with larger shifts being found for the most\nbiased samples, up to 3%. From our analysis we find that physical shifts are\ngreater than ~0.4% at z=0. In redshift space these effects are exacerbated, but\nat higher redshifts are alleviated. We develop an analytical model to\nunderstand this, based on solutions to the pair conservation equation using\ncharacteristic curves. When combined with modeling of pairwise velocities the\nmodel reproduces the main trends found in the data. The model may also help to\nunbias the acoustic peak.\n"

In particular, only systems with\nsufficiently high BH spin parameter $a$ and sufficiently low orbital\ninclinations allow any NS matter to escape or to form a long-lived disk outside\nthe BH horizon after disruption. Mergers of binaries with orbital inclinations\nabove $\\sim60^o$ lead to complete prompt accretion of the entire NS by the BH,\neven for the case of an extreme Kerr BH.

These simulations\nare performed using a new general relativistic numerical code specifically\ndesigned to study this astrophysical scenario. The code is based on the\nconformally-flat approximation of Einstein's field equations and conservative\nformulations of the magneto-hydrodynamics equations. The code has been recently\nupgraded to incorporate a tabulated, microphysical equation of state and an\napproximate deleptonization scheme. This allows us to perform the most\nrealistic simulations of magneto-rotational core collapse to date, which are\ncompared with simulations employing a simplified (hybrid) equation of state,\nwidely used in the relativistic core collapse community. Furthermore,\nstate-of-the-art (unmagnetized) initial models from stellar evolution are used.\nIn general, stellar evolution models predict weak magnetic fields in the\nprogenitors, which justifies our simplification of performing the computations\nunder the approach that we call the passive field approximation for the\nmagnetic field. Our results show that for the core collapse models with\nmicrophysics the saturation of the magnetic field cannot be reached within\ndynamical time scales by winding up the poloidal magnetic field into a toroidal\none. We estimate the effect of other amplification mechanisms including the\nmagneto-rotational instability (MRI) and several types of dynamos.\n"

The angular power spectrum of\nthe FIRB anisotropies could be measured in large-area surveys with the Spectral\nand Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) on the upcoming Herschel observatory.\nTo study statistical properties of these anisotropies, the confusion from\nforeground Galactic dust emission needs to be reduced even in the ``cleanest''\nregions of the sky.The multi-frequency coverage of SPIRE allows the foreground\ndust to be partly separated from the extragalactic background composed of dusty\nstarforming galaxies as well as faint normal galaxies.

We show that an area of about $\\sim$ 400 degrees$^2$\nobserved for about 1000 hours with Herschel-SPIRE and complemented by Planck\nprovides maximal information on the anisotropy power spectrum.

The distribution of\nluminosity distances for sources with the same redshift is asymmetric, with a\npeak at a value larger than the average one. The width of the distribution and\nthe location of the maximum increase with increasing redshift and length scale\nof the inhomogeneities. We compute the induced dispersion and bias on\ncosmological parameters derived from the supernova data. They are too small to\nexplain the perceived acceleration without dark energy, even when the length\nscale of the inhomogeneities is comparable to the horizon distance. Moreover,\nthe dispersion and bias induced by gravitational lensing at the scales of\ngalaxies or clusters of galaxies are larger by at least an order of magnitude.\n"

In this paper, we\npresent new data gained from high-resolution optical spectroscopy and a\ndetailed description of IR data of this star. We present a qualitative study of\nthe numerous emission lines in our optical spectra and the classification of\ntheir line profiles, which indicate a non-spherically symmetric circumstellar\nenvironment. The first real detection of numerous [Fe II] emission lines and of\nmany other permitted and forbidden emission lines is reported. From our optical\ndata, we derive an effective temperature of 14000 K, a radius of 17.3 +/- 0.6\nRsun, as well as a luminosity of 1.0 +/- 0.3 x 10^{4} Lsun. We advocate that\nCD-42o11721 might be a post-main sequence object, even though a pre-main\nsequence nature cannot be ruled out due to the uncertain distance. We further\nfound that the SED in the optical and infrared can best be fitted with an\noutflowing disk-forming wind scenario rather than with a spherical symmetric\nenvelope or with a flared disc, supporting our tentative classification as a\nB[e] supergiant.\n"

From\nthe photosphere and chromosphere into the transition region and the corona\nplasma-$\\beta$ changes from above to below one, i.e. while in the lower\natmosphere the energy density of the plasma dominates, in the upper atmosphere\nthe magnetic field plays the governing role -- one might speak of a ``magnetic\ntransition''. Therefore the dynamics of the overshooting convection in the\nphotosphere, the granulation, is shuffling the magnetic field around in the\nphotosphere. This leads not only to a (re-)structuring of the magnetic field in\nthe upper atmosphere, but induces also the dynamic reaction of the coronal\nplasma e.g. due to reconnection events. Therefore the (complex) structure and\nthe interaction of various magnetic patches is crucial to understand the\nstructure, dynamics and heating of coronal plasma as well as its acceleration\ninto the solar wind.\n  The present article will emphasize the need for three-dimensional modeling\naccounting for the complexity of the solar atmosphere to understand these\nprocesses. Some advances on 3D modeling of the upper solar atmosphere in\nmagnetically closed as well as open regions will be presented together with\ndiagnostic tools to compare these models to observations. This highlights the\nrecent success of these models which in many respects closely match the\nobservations.\n"

As a consequence, the method is able to\nfollow the non-linear evolution of the power-spectrum down to zero redshift and\nto length-scales where perturbation theory fails.\n  Our predictions accurately fit the results of $N$-body simulations in\nreproducing the ``Baryon Acoustic Oscillations'' features of the\npower-spectrum, which will be accurately measured in future galaxy surveys and\nwill provide a probe to distinguish among different dark energy models.\n"

Radiatively\nInefficient Accretion Flows (RIAFs), like the one around the supermassive black\nhole in the center of our Galaxy, are believed to be collisionless. Kinetic MHD\nformalism, based on the moments of the Vlasov equation, is used for linear\nanalysis and nonlinear simulations.\n  ZEUS MHD code is modified to include key kinetic MHD terms: anisotropic\npressure tensor and anisotropic thermal conduction. Simulations use the local\nshearing box approximation. Pressure anisotropy is created, because of the\nadiabatic invariance ($\\mu=p_\\perp/B$), as magnetic field is amplified by the\nMRI. Larmor radius scale instabilities--mirror, ion-cyclotron, and\nfirehose--are excited at large pressure anisotropy. Pressure isotropization due\nto pitch angle scattering by these instabilities is included as a subgrid\nmodel. A key result of the kinetic MHD simulations is that the anisotropic\n(viscous) stress can be as large as the Maxwell stress.\n  A new numerical method to simulate anisotropic thermal conduction with large\ntemperature gradients is suggested. Simple tests show that the centered\ndifferencing of anisotropic thermal conduction can result in heat flowing from\nlower to higher temperatures, giving rise to negative temperatures. Limiting of\ntransverse temperature gradients does not accentuate temperature extrema.\n"

We\nresolve the X-ray emission from the co-located ASCA source into a compact\nobject surrounded by structured diffuse emission that fills the interior of the\nradio shell. The morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of\na pulsar wind nebula. The spectrum of the compact source is well-characterized\nby a power-law with index approx. 1.3, typical of young and energetic\nrotation-powered pulsars. For a distance of 4.5 kpc, consistent with the X-ray\nabsorption, the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of the putative pulsar and nebula is\nL(PSR) = 3.2E33 erg/s and L(PWN) = 1.4E34 erg/s, respectively. Both the flux\nratio of L(PWN)/L(PSR) = 4.3 and the total luminosity of this system imply a\npulsar spin-down power greater then 1E37 erg/s, on a par with the top ten most\nenergetic young pulsars in the Galaxy. We associate the putative pulsar with\nthe radio remnant and the TeV source and discuss the origin of the gamma-ray\nemission.\n"

However, recent surveys show a transition to\nhomogeneity on large scales. The exact scale at which this transition occurs is\nstill a topic of much debate. There has been much work done in trying to\ncharacterise the galaxy distribution using multifractals. However, for a number\nof years the size, depth and accuracy of galaxy surveys was regarded as\ninsufficient to give a definitive answer. One of the main problems which arises\nin a multifractal analysis is how to deal with observational selection effects:\nie `masks' in the survey region and a geometric boundary to the survey itself.\n  In this thesis I will introduce a volume boundary correction which is rather\nsimilar to the approach developed by Pan and Coles in 2001, but which improves\non their angular boundary correction in two important respects: firstly, our\nvolume correction `throws away' fewer galaxies close the boundary of a given\ndata set and secondly it is computationally more efficient.\n  After application of our volume correction, I will then show how the\nunderlying generalised dimensions of a given point set can be computed. I will\napply this procedure to calculate the generalised fractal dimensions of both\nsimulated fractal point sets and mock galaxy surveys which mimic the properties\nof the recent IRAS PSCz catalogue.\n"

The disks are\ninterpreted in terms of two counter-rotating streams of particles on free\ncircular orbits. Two extra parameters -- the constants of motion resulting from\nprojections of the particle-velocities' extra components -- are constrained by\nthe requirement that the orbits within the disk be stable. The requirement is\nmet just in cases when the radial profile of the disk orbital speed fits the\nrotation curves of many spiral galaxies. It thus turns out that the effective\nmodification of the gravity law by extra dimensions could explain the observed\nflatness of these curves equally well as the usually given dark-matter\ninterpretation. In the second part of the paper we show that the inclusion of\nextra dimensions also leads to better fits of the gravitational-lensing data\nfor galaxy clusters, without changing results obtained in solar-system scales.\nFinally, we discuss whether the effect of extra dimensions could also be\ntranslated as following from the occurrence of extra matter (\"Kaluza-Klein\nparticles\").

At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central\ngalaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for\nlarger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higher\nluminosity. Central L* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z~1\nthan at z~0. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of\nhost halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same\nluminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions\nof the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between\nthe galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies to\nz~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us to\nstudy the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. We find that the\nstellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority\nof the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low mass halos\n(~5x10^11 Msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central\ngalaxies of high mass halos (~10^13 Msun/h) result from star formation between\nz~1 and z~0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation\nefficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time.\nFuture work can combine HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different\nredshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter\nhalos. This can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both\nmergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful\ntests of galaxy formation theories.

Only galaxies and/or absorbed AGN may be able contribute the\nremaining unresolved XRB intensity. Our results are compatible, within the\nerrors, with recent revisions of the XRB intensity in the soft and hard bands.\nThe maximum fractional contribution to the XRB comes from fluxes within about a\ndecade of the break in the source counts (~1e-14 cgs), reaching ~50% of the\ntotal in the soft and hard bands.

Here we present spatially resolved spectra of the\nhost galaxy of GRB 060505, an Sbc spiral, at redshift z=0.0889. The GRB\noccurred inside a star-forming region in the northern spiral arm at 6.5 kpc\nfrom the center. From the position of the emission lines, we determine a\nmaximum rotational velocity for the galaxy of v~212km/s corresponding to a mass\nof 1.14x10^11 M_solar within 11 kpc from the center. By fitting single-age\nspectral synthesis models to the stellar continuum, we derive a very young age\nfor the GRB site, confirmed by photometric and Halpha line measurements, of\naround 6 Myr which corresponds to the lifetime of a 32 M_solar star. The\nmetallicity derived from several emission line measurements is lowest at the\nGRB site with 1/5 Z_solar but roughly solar in the rest of the galaxy. Using\nthe 2dF galaxy redshift survey we can locate the host galaxy in its large scale\n(Mpc) environment. The galaxy lies in the foreground of a filamentary\noverdensity extending south west from the galaxy cluster Abell 3837 at\nz=0.0896. The properties of the GRB site are similar to those found for other\nlong-duration GRB host galaxies with high specific star formation rate and low\nmetallicity, which is an indication that GRB 060505 originated from a young\nmassive star that died without making a supernova.\n"

We perform trajectory simulations for proton primaries in the\nprobably more realistic case of discrete sources with a density of\n~10^-5/Mpc^3.

Second, the\nsecondary photon to primary cosmic ray flux ratio between ~3x10^18 eV and\n~10^20 eV decreases with decreasing source density and increasing\nmagnetization. As a consequence, in acceleration scenarios for the origin of\nhighest energy cosmic rays the fraction of secondary photons may be difficult\nto detect even for experiments such as Pierre Auger.

Our aim is to determine how the treatment of convection\nin the atmospheric and sub-atmospheric layers affects the mode identification,\nand what information about the thermal structure of the external layers can be\nobtained from amplitude ratios and phase lags in Str\\\"omgren photometric bands.\nWe derive non-adiabatic parameters for delta Scuti stars by using, for the\nfirst time, stellar models with the same treatment of convection in the\ninterior and in the atmosphere. We compute classical non-gray mixing length\nmodels, and as well non-gray ``Full Spectrum of Turbulence'' models.\nFurthermore, we compute the photometric amplitudes and phases of pulsation by\nusing the colors and the limb-darkening coefficents as derived from the same\natmosphere models used in the stellar modeling. We show that the non-adiabatic\nphase-lag is mainly sensitive to the thermal gradients in the external layers,\n(and hence to the treatment of convection), and that this sensitivity is also\nclearly reflected in the multi-color photometric phase differences.\n"

First, we find that\nthe relation between clustering strength and density is not monotonic: galaxies\nin the densest regions are more strongly clustered than are galaxies in regions\nof moderate overdensity; galaxies in moderate overdensities are more strongly\nclustered than are those in moderate underdensities; but galaxies in moderate\nunderdensities are less clustered than galaxies in the least dense regions. We\nargue that this is natural if clustering evolved gravitationally from a\nGaussian field, since the highest peaks and lowest troughs in Gaussian fields\nare similarly clustered. The precise non-monotonic dependence of galaxy\nclustering on density is very well reproduced in a mock catalog which is based\non a halo-model decomposition of galaxy clustering.\n  Second, the distribution of galaxy counts in our sample is rather well\ndescribed by a Poisson cluster model. We show that, despite their Poisson\nnature, correlations with environment are expected in such models. More\nremarkably, the expected trends are very like those in standard models of halo\nbias, despite the fact that correlations with environment in these models arise\npurely from the fact that dense regions are dense because they happen to host\nmore massive halos. This is in contrast to the usual analysis which assumes\nthat it is the large scale environment which determines the halo mass function.\n[Abridged]\n"

The equivalent widths of the lines are generally consistent between the\nobservations, as expected if these lines originate in the hot interstellar\nmedium. No evidence was found that the lines were blueshifted, again supporting\nthe interstellar medium origin, though this may be due to poor statistics.\nThere is apparent variability in the OVIII Ly-alpha line equivalent width\nproviding some evidence that at least some of the OVIII absorption arises\nwithin the system. However, the significance is marginal (2.4-sigma), and the\nlack of variation in the other lines casts some doubt on the reality of the\nvariability. From calculating the equivalent hydrogen column densities for a\nrange of Doppler parameters, we find they are consistent with the interstellar\norigin of the lines. Additionally we fit the spectra with photoionization\nmodels for locally absorbing material, and find that they can reproduce the\nspectrum well, but only when there is an extremely low filling factor. We\nconclude that both the ISM and local absorption remain possible for the origin\nof the lines, but that more sensitive observations are needed to search for\nlow-level variability.\n"

From an analysis of X-ray observations of\nthese mass concentrations, and the expected photon spectrum of decaying solar\nKK-axions, we derive lower limits to the lifetime of such axions of tau approx.\n10^23 sec.

For each\ngalaxy, we built an SED based on optical-to-8um photometry to estimate the\nphoto-z and to derive the main galaxies physical properties. The majority of\nthe sample sources show degenerate/bimodal solutions for the photometric\nredshifts (Abridged). These can either be heavily dust-enshrouded (Av~2-4)\nstarbursts at 2<z<3 with bolometric luminosities L(IR)>10^12 Lsun, or massive\npost-starburst galaxies in the redshift interval 4<z<9 with stellar masses of\n10^11 Msun. One galaxy, the only source in our sample with both an X-ray and a\n24um detection, might be an extremely massive object at z~8 detected during a\npost-starburst phase with concomitant QSO activity (although a lower-z solution\nis not excluded). Our investigation of Spitzer-selected galaxies with very red\nSEDs and completely undetected in the optical reveals a potential population of\nmassive galaxies at z>4 which appear to include significant AGN emissions.\nThese sources may be the oldest stellar systems at z~4. These, previously\nunrecognized, optically obscured objects might provide an important\ncontribution to the massive-end (M>10^11 sun) of the high-z stellar mass\nfunction and they would almost double it (Abridged).\n"

Galaxies are divided into 6\nsamples according to luminosity, and each of these samples is divided into red\nand blue subsamples. Projected auto-correlation and cross-correlation is\nestimated for these subsample. At projected separations r_p > 1\\mpch, all\ncorrelation functions are roughly parallel, although the correlation amplitude\ndepends systematically on luminosity and color. On r_p < 1\\mpch, the auto- and\ncross-correlation functions of red galaxies are significantly enhanced relative\nto the corresponding power laws obtained on larger scales. Such enhancement is\nabsent for blue galaxies and in the cross-correlation between red and blue\ngalaxies. We esimate the relative bias factor on scales r > 1\\mpch for each\nsubsample using its auto-correlation function and cross-correlation functions.\nThe relative bias factors obtained from different methods are similar. For blue\ngalaxies the luminosity-dependence of the relative bias is strong over the\nluminosity range probed (-23.0<M_r < -18.0),but for red galaxies the dependence\nis weaker and becomes insignificant for luminosities below L^*. To examine\nwhether a significant stochastic/nonlinear component exists in the bias\nrelation, we study the ratio R_ij= W_{ii}W_{jj}/W_{ij}^2, where W_{ij} is the\nprojected correlation between subsample i and j. We find that the values of\nR_ij are all consistent with 1 for all-all, red-red and blue-blue samples,\nhowever significantly larger than 1 for red-blue samples. For faint red - faint\nblue samples the values of R_{ij} are as high as ~ 2 on small scales r_p < 1\n\\mpch and decrease with increasing r_p.\n"

For the specific choice of the Newtonian\npotential, the flow has only two critical points, of which the outer one is a\nsaddle point while the inner one is a centre-type point. A restrictive upper\nbound is imposed on the admissible range of values of the angular momentum of\nsub-Keplerian flows through a saddle point. These flows are very unstable to\nany deviation from a necessarily precise boundary condition. The difficulties\nagainst the physical realisability of a solution passing through the saddle\npoint have been addressed through a temporal evolution of the flow, which gives\na non-perturbative mechanism for selecting a transonic solution passing through\nthe saddle point. An equation of motion for a real-time perturbation about the\nstationary flows reveals a very close correspondence with the metric of an\nacoustic black hole, which is also an indication of the primacy of\ntransonicity.\n"

Here, the dynamical influence of both\nthe Galactic bar and the outer spiral pattern are taken into account. The Milky\nWay disc is stirred by analytical potentials that are chosen to represent the\ntwo perturbations, the ratio of pattern speeds of which is explored, rather\nthan held constant. The velocity structure of the final configuration is\npresented as heliocentric velocity distributions at different locations. These\nmodel velocity distributions are compared to the observed distribution in terms\nof a goodness-of-fit parameter that has been formulated here. We monitor the\nspatial distribution of the maximal value of this parameter, in order to\nconstrain the solar position from a model. Efficiency of a model is based on a\nstudy of this distribution as well as on other independent dynamical\nconsiderations. We reject the bar only and spiral only models and arrive at the\nfollowing bar parameters from the bar+spiral simulations: bar pattern speed of\n57.4^{+2.8}_{-3.3} km/s/kpc and a bar angle in [0^\\circ$, 30^\\circ$]. However,\nextracting information in this way is no longer viable when the dynamical\ninfluence of the spiral pattern does not succumb to that of the bar. Orbital\nanalysis indicates that even though the basic bimodality in the local velocity\ndistribution can be attributed to scattering off the Outer Lindblad Resonance\nof the bar, it is the interaction of irregular orbits and orbits of other\nresonant families, that is responsible for the other moving groups; it is\nrealised that such interaction increases with the warmth of the background\ndisk.\n"

From the column density ratios and the relative populations of H2\nrotational and CI fine-structure levels, we derive the physical conditions\n(relative abundances, dust-depletion, particle density, kinetic temperature and\nionizing flux) and discuss physical conditions in the neutral phase. Molecular\nhydrogen is detected in seven components in the first four rotational levels (J\n= 0-3) of the vibrational ground state. Absorption lines of H2 J = 4 (resp. J =\n5) are also detected in six (resp. two) of these components. This leads to a\ntotal molecular fraction of log f = -1.69+0.37-0.58. We confirm the earlier\nfindings that there is a correlation between N(FeII)/N(SII) and N(SiII)/N(SII)\nindicative of a dust-depletion pattern. Surprisingly, however, the depletion of\nmetals onto dust in the H2 components is not large in this system: [Fe/S] =\n-0.8 to -0.1. The gas in H2-bearing components is found to be cold but still\nhotter than similar gas in our Galaxy (T > 130 K, instead of typically 80 K).\nand dense (n=100-200 cm^-3). There is an anti-correlation between the logarithm\nof the photo-absorption rate, and log N(H2)/N(CI) derived for each H2\ncomponent. We show that this is mostly due to shielding effects and implies\nthat the photo- absorption rate is a good indicator of the physical conditions\nin the gas. We find that the gas is immersed in a intense UV field, about one\norder of magnitude higher than in the solar vicinity.

Fluid motions\ninferred from the shock strength and morphology can be compared to the cold\ndark matter (CDM) distribution inferred from gravitational lensing. A detailed\nreconstruction of the CDM kinematics, however, must take into account the\nnontrivial response of the fluid intracluster medium to the collisionless CDM\nmotions. We have carried out two-dimensional simulations of gas dynamics in\ncluster collisions. We analyze the relative motion of the clusters, the bow\nshock wave, and the contact discontinuity and relate these to X-ray data. We\nfocus on the \"bullet cluster,\" 1E 0657-56, a near head-on collision of\nunequal-mass clusters, for which the gas density and temperature jumps across\nthe prominent bow shock imply a high shock velocity 4,700 km/s. The velocity of\nthe fluid shock has been widely interpreted as the relative velocity of the CDM\ncomponents. This need not be the case, however. An illustrative simulation\nfinds that the present relative velocity of the CDM halos is 16% lower than\nthat of the shock. While this conclusion is sensitive to the detailed initial\nmass and gas density profile of the colliding clusters, such a decrease of the\ninferred halo relative velocity would increase the likelihood of finding 1E\n0657-56 in a LambdaCDM universe.\n"

Ground-based AO provides better light gathering power\nand in principle better resolution than HST, giving it the edge in high spatial\nresolution imaging and high resolution spectroscopy. HST produces higher\nquality, more stable PSF's over larger field-of-view's in a much darker\nsky-background than ground-based AO, and yields deeper wide-field images and\nlow-resolution spectra than the ground. Faint galaxies have steadily decreasing\nsizes at fainter fluxes and higher redshifts, reflecting the hierarchical\nformation of galaxies over cosmic time. HST has imaged this process in great\nstructural detail to z<~6, and ground-based AO and spectroscopy has provided\nmeasurements of their masses and other physical properties with cosmic time.\nLast, we review how the 6.5 meter James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will\nmeasure First Light, reionization, and galaxy assembly in the near--mid-IR\nafter 2013.\n"

Strong planet--planet gravitational\nscattering could produce both high eccentricities and, after tidal\ncircularization, very short-period planets, as observed in the exoplanet\npopulation. We present new results for this scenario based on extensive\ndynamical integrations of systems containing three giant planets, both with and\nwithout residual gas disks. We assign the initial planetary masses and orbits\nin a realistic manner following the core accretion model of planet formation.\nWe show that, with realistic initial conditions, planet--planet scattering can\nreproduce quite well the observed eccentricity distribution.

Previous studies for simple initial configurations with two\nequal-mass planets revealed some discrepancies between the results of numerical\nsimulations and the observed orbital elements of extrasolar planets. Here, we\nshow that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circular\norbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of final\neccentricities. The two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce the\nobserved eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios.\nFurther, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of\nabout 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that\nboth planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. This compares\nfavorably with current observations and will be tested by future planet\ndiscoveries. The combination of planet--planet scattering and tidal\ncircularization may be able to explain the existence of some giant planets with\nvery short period orbits. Orbital migration due to planet scattering could play\nan important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with very\nshort period orbits. We also re-examine and discuss various possible\ncorrelations between eccentricities and other properties of observed extrasolar\nplanets. We demonstrate that the observed distribution of planet masses,\norbital periods, and eccentricities can provide constraints for models of\nplanet formation and evolution.\n"

        "title-abstract": "The initial mass function of simple and composite stellar populations:   (abridged) The case can be made for a rather universal stellar IMF form that\ncan be approximated by a two-part power-law function in the stellar regime.\nHowever, there exists a possible hint for a systematic variation with\nmetallicity. A picture is emerging according to which the binary properties of\nvery-low-mass stars (VLMSs) and BDs may be fundamentally different from those\nof late-type stars implying the probable existence of a discontinuity in the\nIMF, but the surveys also appear to suggest the number of BDs per star to be\nindependent of the physical conditions of current Galactic star formation.\nStar-burst clusters and thus globular cluster may, however, have a much larger\nabundance of BDs. Very recent advances have allowed the measurement of the\nphysical upper stellar mass limit, which also appears to be disconcertingly\nrobust to variations in metallicity. Furthermore, it now appears that star\nclusters may be formed such that the most-massive stars just forming terminate\nfurther star-formation within the particular cluster. Populations formed from\nmany star clusters, composite populations, would then have steeper IMFs (fewer\nmassive stars per low-mass star) than the simple populations in the constituent\nclusters. A near invariant star-cluster mass function implies the maximal\ncluster mass to correlate with the galaxy-wide star-formation rate. This then\nleads to the result that the composite-stellar IMFs vary in dependence of\ngalaxy type, with potentially dramatic implications for theories of galaxy\nformation and evolution.\n"

In\nthis paper a rotating, cratered asteroid model is described, and used to\ngenerate infrared fluxes which are then interpreted using the Near Earth\nAsteroid Thermal Model (NEATM). Even though the rotating, cratered model\ndepends on three parameters not available to the NEATM (the dimensionless\nthermal inertia parameter and pole orientation), the NEATM gives diameter\nestimates that are accurate to 10 percent RMS for phase angles less than 60\ndegrees. For larger phase angles, such as back-lit asteroids, the infrared flux\ndepends more strongly on these unknown parameters, so the diameter errors are\nlarger. These results are still true for the non-spherical shapes typical of\nsmall Near Earth objects.\n"

AGN\n  flaring and central starburst fueled by recycled gas:   The importance of the radiative feedback from massive black holes at the\ncenters of elliptical galaxies is not in doubt, given the well established\nrelations among electromagnetic output, black hole mass and galaxy optical\nluminosity. We show how this AGN radiative output affects the hot ISM of an\nisolated elliptical galaxy with the aid of a high-resolution hydrodynamical\ncode, where the cooling and heating functions include photoionization plus\nCompton heating. We find that radiative heating is a key factor in the\nself-regulated coevolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies and\nthat 1) the mass accumulated by the central black hole is limited by feedback\nto the range observed today, and 2) relaxation instabilities occur so that duty\ncycles are small enough (~0.03) to account for the very small fraction of\nmassive ellipticals observed to be in the \"on\" -QSO- phase, when the accretion\nluminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity. The duty cycle of the hot\nbubbles inflated at the galaxy center during major accretion episodes is of the\norder of 0.1-0.4. Major accretion episodes caused by cooling flows in the\nrecycled gas produced by normal stellar evolution trigger nuclear starbursts\ncoincident with AGN flaring. During such episodes the central sources are often\nobscured; but overall, in the bursting phase (1<z<3), the duty cycle of the\nblack hole in its \"on\" phase is of the order of percents and it is unobscured\napproximately one-third of the time. Mechanical energy output from\nnon-relativistic gas winds integrates to 2.3 10^{59} erg, with most of it\ncaused by broadline AGN outflows. [abridged]\n"

However there will be a reduction in the\npredicted neutrino flux if cosmic ray sources accelerate not only protons but\nalso significant number of heavier nuclei, as is indicated by recent air shower\ndata. We consider plausible extragalactic sources such as active galactic\nnuclei, gamma-ray bursts and starburst galaxies and demand consistency with the\nobserved cosmic ray composition and energy spectrum at Earth after allowing for\npropagation through intergalactic radiation fields. This allows us to calculate\nthe expected neutrino fluxes from the sources, normalised to the observed\ncosmic ray spectrum. We find that the likely signals are still within reach of\nnext generation neutrino telescopes such as IceCube.\n"
